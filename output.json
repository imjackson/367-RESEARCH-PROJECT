This means i cant hook it up with a connection to the state at init and have to find another method to pass the data.\nSome of my ideas:\nCreate a protocol factory factory that creates the state sharing at init. Seems bit dumb.\nCreate a singleton via an internal state module that has a data sink method for the protocol to use and internal data parsing and what not and another public api for getting the current state. This could do the trick, but singleton...\nAnother idea was to try use rxpy as im familiar with rx on .NET. Havent figured out how to implement it asyncronously and not even sure it needs to be async and which version of the library to use...\nAnother dumb idea is to biggyback on the logging module and do the state mutation via that. Logging internally implements pub sub so it would work but at the cost of being clever with in built libraries that werent meant for that specific task.\nOne more idea is to be a good boy and get state out of the code as the functional way and instead write it to a data storage unit like sqlite or w/e and then create a second program to check the state and execute logic based on that. Since nothing needs to be done in the same second there is no timing constraints. A con is the data read and writes - i would rather have everything on ram.

In memory, this is three bytes: `0x41, 0x0A, 0x42`, or `A`, `linefeed`, `B`.

And if you ask for the `repr()` of that string variable, it will back-convert the `0x0A` byte to `\"\\n\"` in printing it out. If you just `print()` the string, though, it'll give you a real linefeed and put the `B` on the following line.; Since Python has those escaping rules involving the backslash, if you want an actual backslash character in your string, you would ordinarily use `\"\\\\\"` in your code, which is just one character in memory, and prints out as just `\\`. Though again, if you ask for the `repr()` form of the string, Python will back-convert to `\"\\\\\"` since `repr()` is supposed to be the source-code form of the string, basically. So if you want a literal `\\*`, two characters, you should have `\"\\\\*\"` in your source code.; What you have now works only because there is no defined `\\*` escape sequence, so Python just says, \"Oh, he probably just meant a literal backslash in this case.\" However, when it gives you back the `repr()` form, it gives you the more proper source-code format, `\"\\\\*\"`.

So if it has been publicly set like: `instance.attribute = some_value`, I can use a property to route this through a setter and check the if, for example, `some_value` is in a specific range.\n\nThis makes sense to me. However, what if want to use a setter as defined above, but indicate to the user that it is not part of the public API of the class?\n\nFor example, if I don\u2019t want client code to use a specific attribute, I\u2019d write `self._attribute`. How would I do this with property decorator?", "Hm, I thought it is more readable and contained in that class.\n\nI have an instance of an Account class, modeling a bank account.

All of the issues you were running into were syntax errors. It would likely be a good idea to check out the tutorial on the official docs site: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html> \u2014 The specific syntax errors you had were: 1. Invalid/inconsistent tabs; Python uses tabs to denote blocks of code (effectively \u201cscope\u201d), whereas other languages use things like curly braces (`{` and `}`) to denote blocks of code. 2. The `assert` keyword has a specific invocation pattern. You need an expression to assert, and more generally `assert`ing an object will _evaluate_ your expression in an attempt to confirm that it is \u201cTruthy\u201d (i.e. using `bool(expression)` will return `True`), otherwise it will raise an `AssertionError`.; In your case specifically, you\u2019re using the python shell, which is an interactive program where you type code directly into the interpreter. It\u2019s still a python interpreter and still requires valid python syntax, so tabs are still a requirement. The tricky thing about the python shell is that it\u2019s not really practical to build any significant/major behavior through the interactive interpreter, which is why I suggested putting your code in a file instead and running it using the `python my_tests.py` command.; Further, the `if __name__ == '__main__': test_all()` line is what tells python what code to run. This is more or less standard boiler plate for python applications/code, it\u2019s somewhat analogous to other language \u201cmain\u201d functions. For example, in java you\u2019d use `public static void main(String[] args)`, in C it\u2019s `int main()`, etc. etc.; I hope that\u2019s clear, but definitely let me know if I can clarify this further.", "Anyone happen to know how I can pass a list in a cli arg(argparse)\n`python foo.py --data [{'key':'value'}, {'key': 'value'}]`", "yea that would make a lot more sense.; my outout that Id like to read in is `[{'key':'value'}, {'key': 'value'}]` do you suggest, i save that as a temp json file? and pass in that json", "I'd tend to suggest that, since you're going to have a hell of a time with getting the escaping right with braces, brackets, and quotes on the command line.", "i will change the data to `{\"data\": [{'key':'value'}, {'key': 'value'}]`; <@Sasha> check ou this hack", "thats my only concern.

Anybody wanna take a stab at helping me resolve what I think is a circular import problem in a django app? I'll have to share a bunch of code so didn't wanna flood the chat; I think it's just bad the way I've designed it so I'm trying to rearrange things a bit; basically the problem is I have an API which I built as a project app, which supplies all the data for my site and it uses DRF. However, I also have a blog app, which uses wagtail, which also uses DRF. So I had to do some custom permissions magic cause Wagtail was trying to send its API requests through my personal API's custom permissions classes, and now I've got a permissions module in my API app which I need in my `settings.py`, but the permissions module requires some things out of `settings.py` to determine the permissions. Lol; Here is some relevant info if it helps.\n\nMy API's *custom_permissions.py:*\n```\nfrom rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission\nfrom rest_framework.exceptions import MethodNotAllowed\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nCURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS\nCURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = settings.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS\n\nclass IsPremium(BasePermission):\n    \"\"\"\n    API restriction to premium users only.\n    \"\"\"\n    def has_permission(self, request, view):\n        # Do stuff w/ variables from above to determine permissions\n```\n\n*settings/base.py:*\n```\nimport os, sys\n\n# For local dev\nif os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':\n    from . import env_dev as env\nelse:\n    from . import env\n\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))\nPROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'apps'))\n\n# Env settings\nSECRET_KEY = env.SECRET_KEY\nDEBUG = env.DEBUG\n... other vars\nCURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS\nCURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = env.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS\n\n# Custom permissions for personal API\nfrom lfa_lite.apps.api.permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium\n\n# ... other settings\n\n# Default DRF stuff for Wagtail to segregate it from my API\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',\n    ),\n    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',\n    )\n}\n\n# For my personal API. Checks both IsAuthenticated as well as custom stuff\nLFA_API_SETTINGS = {\n    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (\n        IsPremium,\n    )\n}\n```\n\nSnippet of my API's *views.py*:\n```\nfrom rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet\nfrom rest_framework.decorators import action\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Get default perms from settings, so I can change it in only one place if needed, or add more perms\nLFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = settings.LFA_API_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']\n\nclass SomeViewSet(ViewSet):\n    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do stuff\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_other_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do other stuff\n\nclass OtherViewSet(ViewSet):\n    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_different_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do different stuff\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_other_different_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do other different stuff\n\n# ... lots more ViewSets and APIViews\n```\n\nThe actual issue is that when I launch it into my staging environment on AWS (elastic beanstalk) the `SECRET_KEY` is coming back as empty, I think because the circular dependency is causing it to fail loading the settings. In staging, I use a staging.py settings file which basically is just `from base import *` and adds a few other variables for AWS and my live database and stuff.; So it turns out if I remove the `IsPremium` import from base.py and the one setting that uses it, and instead import `IsPremium` directly into custom_permissions.py, the app deploys normally but fails data migrations. That's a different problem, but I'm still wondering if anyone can see a way to be able to control the default permissions class in settings.py instead of having to do it in the API views like this:\n\n```\nfrom .permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium\nLFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = (IsPremium,)\n```\n\nIt would just be nice to have a single place to manage everything where the settings for DRF already live. :man-shrugging:", "that doesn't seem like python to me..."], "1678": ["None; what is the format of the output?", "yes its a groovy", "lists in python are separated by commas", "my bad forgot to mention its a groovy", "I don't know what a groovy is :slightly_smiling_face:", "okay", "is that just a JSON string?; if so you can just use `.replace(';', ',')` to replace all the semicolons w/ commas and then `json.loads()`", "i have a json string so am getting the values from a json string and am getting the values in that format; i tried that but in groovy i dont think we have json.loads()", "what is groovy??; that would help, lol", "its a scripting language close to java syntax", "<http://groovy-lang.org>", "ah ok.

Your microservice itself should be able to treat the face detection tool as a black box that it just passes an image (or image location) to and gets back the bounding box. This makes your code less coupled, and makes writing tests much easier; I would recommend trying to create an importable package that you can keep totally separate of your microservice's code.

I have a bit of an implementation problem and I'd like your professional suggestion. I'm using FlaskSQLAlchemy for the management of the database object.\n\nIn my project, which you can think of as a SaaS, when you create a Company(sort of), this company has to subscribe by making payment to _my_ company. This subscription could be for a month, a quarter/half of a year, or it cover a whole year. When the company's subscription is active, all routes in _my_ company's API would be accessible but immediately the subscription expires, none of the routes become accessible. It sends you a *subscription ended* RESTful result.\n\nNow, there's a model `Company` that has several columns, one of each is `subscriptions` which is *supposed* to hold all the subscriptions that a company has made including the expired subscriptions and the current active one. \n\n```\nclass Company (db.Model):\n    __tablename__ = 'companies'\n    subscriptions = db.relationship('Subscription', backref='company', lazy='dynamic')\n   # followed by several other columns\n\nclass Subscription (db.Model):\n# stuffs\n\n```\n\nNow my question is, how do you think I can implement the subscription 'model' such that when I add a `@active_subscription_on` decorator on a route, this decorator checks the current user's company's subscription to see if their subscription is active?\n\nHow can I implement the subscription system?; Here's what I've thought of(although I haven't implemented it): when your company _clicks_ on buy subscription(to generate a key, think Windows OS serial key), for a month, I use `itsdangerous`'s `TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer` to encode the duration of the subscription, then use `base64` on the result for something readable. That gives me the key to give to the company and when entered to extend their subscription days, I simply reverse the process to get the duration the subscription will cover. I can then add this period to the company's list of subscriptions. \n\nNow, I don't really know how to make the decorator gain access to this information and be quick with it!", "I did something similar in one of the decoratos:\n\n```\ndef permission_required(permission):\n    def wrap(function):\n        @wraps(function)\n        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):\n            if (not current_user) or (current_user.role &lt;= permission):\n                response = jsonify({'status': 430, 'error': 'Permission denied',\n                                    'message': 'Unable to get required permission '\n                                               'for this request'})\n                response.status_code = 430\n            return function(*args, **kwargs)\n        return decorated_function\nreturn wrap\n\n(SUPER_USER, ADMINISTRATOR, BASIC_USER) = (0x4C, 0x4B, 0x4A)\nhttps_url_for = partial(http_url_for, _scheme='https', _external=True)\n\n\ndef admin_required(function):\n  return permission_required(ADMINISTRATOR)(function)\n```"], "2061": ["Hi there, I have a similar setup where I check if a user\u2019s role is permitted for a particular route.

I'm then running it through loop below to poll the data and check minute by minute in my interested time period how many calls were active at the polling time.  This works ok, but it is slow, and I'm going to be missing data still (calls that start and end between polling periods), There are a few ways I can think of to catch those calls as well but it's going to make this even slower..is there a better way I should be doing this?

What is the next thing we do, now that we've run out of characters? We \"carry the 1\" and start on the next number place with `10`. Notice how we have a 1 in the tens place and a 0 in the ones place. This is because we have 1 ten and 0 ones. We started over with the ones and looped back around to zero; Binary works the same way. It's just a base-2 system, so there's only 2 number characters, and the number places are exponents of 2 instead of 10 (e.g. the ones place, the twos place, the fours place); If I wanted all the permutations of base-10 numbers that go up to 999, I would just start counting at 000; The trick is that the characters I use to represent the numbers doesn't actually matter, so long as they're consistent; <@Roxie> so it looks like you're trying to scrape YouTube comments.
