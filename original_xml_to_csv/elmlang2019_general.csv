1,1546250595.3883,Earlean,<@Fred> `--optimize` doesn't minify but it does have an output that is easier to minify <https://guide.elm-lang.org/optimization/asset_size.html#instructions> provides the best command for minifying

2,1546261010.3906,Santina,"Happy new year all. I'm wondering why in the Elm docs, it is so discouraged to write effect manager helpers? If I knew why it was discouraged, it might give me an idea for how to implement some kind of alternative. <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform>"
2,1546261378.3921,Mirian,I don't think you even CAN write an effect manager since 0.19
2,1546261389.3923,Santina,"It seems possible given the documentation,; unless the documentation is outdated"
2,1546261417.3927,Mirian,Yeah I think this is outdated but somebody got to confirm this ; As to why - we loose all guarantees that elm gives us when we just wrap js code ; If you need to access some js library ports are the way to go
2,1546261665.3933,Virgie,"effect managers are not necessarily using JS code though. The main problem with them is that they store state outside of the model. This does indeed break the nice guarantees that elm otherwise provides.

They are also discouraged because they are the ""easy"" solution, thinking about the problem harder in an elm context likely gives a better solution"
2,1546261745.3935,Santina,"Thanks for the tips, <@Mirian> and <@Virgie>!"
3,1546263860.3959,Lavonna,"I'm trying to write a shrinker (elm-explorations/test v1.2.0) for my own data structure but fail to import module 'Lazy.List' (""I cannot find that module!"").
Importing module 'Shrink' works without problems.
Any ideas?"
3,1546264101.3965,Virgie,looks like it is not exported. Do you need anything besides the type signature? (also try <#C0CLGCMMF|testing> )
3,1546265099.4001,Lavonna,"Where do you get the info from that it is not exported? (-&gt;Where should I look to find this out myself?) I thought I need it because the 'Shrink' doc (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/1.2.0/Shrink>) says a shrinker should produce a lazy list and I had a look at the provided implementations.
Can I produce any kind of lazy list (maybe from other packages)?; ah . . . ""elm.json"" in the package source contains the info, what modules are exposed"
3,1546265863.4014,Virgie,in the docs <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest/Shrink#lazylist> exposed types are blue/clickable. `LazyList` isn't
4,1546265984.4015,Howard,not true - for example `Shrinker` is exposed but not blue/clickable
3,1546266376.4017,Virgie,"Hmm, that did work before. Might be dropped in 0.19; also it does work for `elm/core` <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/String>; maybe it only works for types and not aliases?"
3,1546266768.4024,Rosalee,Can someone explain what is meant by “effect manager”?
3,1546267642.4027,Virgie,"they are something used in the implementation of subscriptions and commands, for instance the browser package uses them for keyboard and mouse events <https://github.com/elm/browser/blob/1.0.1/src/Browser/Events.elm#L246>; but, like native code, they break guarantees and thus can only be used by the core team in specific packages"
3,1546268460.4031,Lavonna,thx - wasn't aware that the links correspond to the exposed types
5,1546270658.406,Lavonna,"Although in my special case (at most one possibility ever) I would conceptually get away with a regular list, the compiler insists on a 'Lazy.List.LazyList' . . . is there a more elegant way to solve this, than to replicate/copy the corresponding non-exposed code from 'elm-explorations/test'?"
3,1546272742.4067,Virgie,really depends on the specifics I think. The folks in <#C0CLGCMMF|testing> will know more (also sharing the specifics might help)

18,1546467648.4563,Su,I am looking at the documentation for Random (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/Random>); and see that the signature for `generate` is `generate : (a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Generator a -&gt; Cmd msg`; is there a name for the (a -&gt; msg) part? Asking because I want to pass my random function a `(a -&gt; msg)`
18,1546467779.4567,Virgie,it is often a (partially applied) constructor of your `Msg` type; so if `Msg  = Thing1 Int Int | Thing2 String` then `Thing1 42` and `Thing2` are both values of type `something -&gt; Msg`; and `Thing1` and `Thing2` are the constructors of `Msg`
18,1546467935.4591,Su,"Ah, ok, thanks! Constructor makes sense. This makes the signature of the function I am working on look like:
```
generatePassword : (String -&gt; Msg) -&gt; Cmd Msg
generatePassword msgConstructor =

18,1546468086.4607,Virgie,"in that context I think I would go for `toMsg`, but your name would be unremarkable (which is good!)"

18,1546468530.463,Kris,"<@Su> note that you don’t need to make that Msg concrete, you can keep it a type variable to get a more generic function "
19,1546468556.4635,Earleen,<@Virgie> thanks
18,1546468767.4642,Su,"Thanks! I tried having signatures of both `(a -&gt; Msg)` and `(String -&gt; msg)`; but the compiler warned me:
```
Hint: Your type annotation uses type variable `msg` which means ANY type of
value can flow through, but your code is saying it specifically wants a `Msg`
value. Maybe change your type annotation to be more specific? Maybe change the
code to be more general?

27,1546552968.5164,Melodee,"Hi everyone and happy new year! If you missed it last month, we’re excited to announce Elm in the Spring, a new one-day single-track conference for developers interested in Elm! Join us in Chicago on April 26th, 2019 for a great day of learning, teaching, and community. <https://www.elminthespring.org>; Our CFP is open — if you have an idea or story you want to share with the Elm community, we’d love to hear what you have to say! :grinning:"
28,1546564479.5184,Kimiko,"Hi everyone! Does anyone know whether the 0.19 elm/random module supersedes the elm-random-extended-pcg library? I'm trying to figure out a way forward for <https://github.com/danyx23/elm-uuid/issues/10>; Never mind, I think the answer is ""no, it doesn't"""
29,1546589405.5192,Arie,I'm trying out the navbar in rundis/elm-bootstrap. It looks a little weird and fails to collapse. I'm using elm 0.19. Same thing when I try this example <http://elm-bootstrap.info/getting-started> Anyone who tried this?
29,1546590037.5213,Jin,<@Arie> Do you have the navbar subscriptions enabled in your app? Have you linked to the (correct) bootstrap CSS? Those are just questions off the top of my head. People in <#C3U2E3JRX|elm-bootstrap> might know more.
29,1546590700.5226,Arie,"<@Jin> I have the navbar subscription. I have not linked the bootstrap CSS, can you give any hint on how to do so?"
29,1546590970.5264,Jin,"As mentioned in the linked guide you could use `Bootstrap.CDN.stylesheet` to create an inline style node. This works, also in `elm reactor`, but is not meant to be used for serious applications. There you could link to a hosted CSS via a normal link tag in your Html file, `&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"" integrity=""sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm"" crossorigin=""anonymous""&gt;`. Or, if you have some build tooling in place, you could add the CSS as a dependency and import and build it like your other CSS."
29,1546591958.5272,Arie,<@Jin> You pointed me in the right direction and it work perfectly! Thank you.
30,1546614643.5312,Lynne,"Hey folks. I think I know the answer to my question but there is a chance I am missing something. Say I have a list of rose trees where each node contains an object of the same type. I would like to work with this ""forest"" as if it is a rose tree to use zipper etc. This is easily achievable by catering some root item which would be a non-meaningful value of the same type which all trees are using. But that's what I would like to avoid. Is there any way to model it somehow?"
30,1546616159.5318,Lashawnda,What about a list zipper over a list of tree zippers
30,1546616361.5328,Lynne,"I won't be able to use library dedicated for rose trees then (like zwilias/elm-rosetree which I am currently adopting); I mean I won't be able to use to full power (like traversing ""forward"" to a next  tree if there is no child which is exactly what I want)"
30,1546616472.534,Kris,I didn’t quite understand what you wanted ; But I think it’s a zipper over the tree 
30,1546616497.5347,Lynne,"Yes, with exception; Root of this tree does not contain something which is contained within its descendants; Imagine a `Tree (Maybe a)` where root is `Tree Nothing` but all children are always `Tree (Just a)`; That's basically what I'd like to model"
30,1546616655.5381,Kris,"Well, you should probably model it as something like `type MyThing a = Root Something (Tree a)` ; That’s probably easier than trying to stuff it in the same type "
30,1546616846.5402,Lynne,Not sure I understand. Do you suggest using a type with single constructor where root would be `Root Something &lt;no tree&gt;` and every descendant `Root &lt;nothing&gt; &lt;some tree&gt;`?
31,1546637213.5435,Monte,Is there any way to find out which github repos use a particular elm package?
30,1546637363.5442,Alicia,"hmm, maybe not bulletproof but how about something like <https://github.com/search?q=noredink%2Felm-json-decode-pipeline+filename%3Aelm.json&amp;type=Code>"
30,1546637945.5444,Huong,That's a pretty interesting problem!
31,1546638114.5459,Nery,"how would one build a heterogenous Dict-like (Hash-like, Map-like) data structure in Elm? ie, w/ homogenous (say, String keys) but w/ heterogenous values?"
30,1546638165.5466,Timika,"How heterogenous  is it? If it’s just a small set of types, you could create a custom type that wraps those under one unified type.; ```type HValue
    = StringValue String
    | IntValue Int
    | ArrayIntValue (Array Int)
``` for example. But you have to wrap and unwrap yourself."
30,1546638274.5489,Nery,"ah nice
so, eg, `type Value = String | Int | Time` ?
but i suppose for more arbitrary number of types....
or is this the only viable way to achieve this"
30,1546638292.5493,Monte,"<@Alicia> thanks, more or less what I needed :smiley:"
30,1546638307.5498,Nery,"<@Timika> i see i have to have constructors; there is great value in other langs in ""programming w/ maps""  per se
should i not expect to get that kind of experience in Elm (strongly typed land)?"
30,1546638349.5513,Timika,"Both key and value of a dict must a of _one_ specific type. I know now other way to achieve this, other with a new type that wraps multiple types.; If `Dict` would allow multiple kinds of type as value at the same time, how would you know what type `Dict.get ""key""` results in? :slightly_smiling_face:"
30,1546638448.5531,Monte,<@Nery> Are you asking in general or is there a specific problem you want to solve?
30,1546638480.5542,Timika,<@Monte> is asking the real questions here :slightly_smiling_face:
30,1546638481.5543,Nery,"well a generally approach i take in other languages is to model my data based on a vocabulary of facts
and these usually go into a Dict-like structure but obviously the types vary; so it would be great to be able to say ""age"" is Int"
30,1546638522.5554,Timika,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but would that not be a record?"
30,1546638526.5555,Nery,"to put the type on the _key_ itself, eg; ...which you can get with _records_, i realize but then i have to create a huge type taxonomy or something ... ie, that's cheating cos it's not on the key the type of the key is for that record only"
30,1546638605.5573,Timika,Can you give an example what you mean by “model my data based on a vocabulary of facts”?
30,1546638621.5578,Nery,"well here's an example... i want a function like
`isOldEnough()`; `isOldEnough : Entity -&gt; Boolean`"
30,1546638672.559,Timika,"```isOldEnough : { a | age : Int } -&gt; Bool
isOldEnough { age } =
    age &gt;= 18```"
30,1546638673.5592,Nery,"wherein isOldEnough could be defined as such:
`isOldEnough = get ""age"" Entity &gt; 21`"
30,1546638680.5594,Timika,would be a way to do this with records
30,1546638686.5597,Nery,gotcha
30,1546638696.5602,Kris,Relevant to programming with maps <https://mobile.twitter.com/EvilHaskellTips/status/433449719226826752>
30,1546638696.5603,Timika,then you can pass in every record with an `age` field.
30,1546638719.561,Nery,with an `_Int_``age` field; cool
30,1546638726.5614,Timika,"Correct, yes."
30,1546638761.5623,Nery,<@Kris> okay that evil tip has got me intrigued; thx <@Timika>.. i know that's newbie stuff. i prolly should be in <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> on that question .. thank you
30,1546638812.5633,Timika,"No worries! Happy to help wherever I can! :slightly_smiling_face:; Yeah, cake! :slightly_smiling_face:"
30,1546639140.5659,Nery,"another pesky question...
what's the significance of requiring `age` to be defined in record after record
why couldn't age simply be defined as Int w/o marrying it to a record
are there strongly typed PLs that allow stuff like this.
it seems rather silly or redundant to have to keep re-defining `age` across N records as an Int
(i assume haskell makes you do the same thing?)"
30,1546639241.5683,Kris,"I don’t understand your question, but you can just write that function as an `Int -&gt; Bool` and call it as `f myRecord.age`; Haskell doesn’t really have records, so nope : p "
30,1546639356.5714,Nery,"but what if my logic is based on not just age, eg
`canRideThisRide : Entity -&gt; Bool`
...where in you have to be 10 or older and your height has to be greater than 1.5m, say...; so i have `age`, an Int, and `height`, a Float, say"
30,1546639402.5724,Timika,That works the same way as with my example code. You can _match_ on multiple fields.
30,1546639446.5733,Carman,"Are you trying to be super generic here? Or could `Entity` be a record that has all the fields you want:
```
type alias Entity =
  { age : Int
  , height : Float
  , name : String
  , ...
  }
```"
30,1546639500.5744,Nery,"ah i like that <@Carman>
would that be acceptable approach or .. an anti-pattern..?"
30,1546639500.5745,Carman,"Then you could say:
```
canRideThisRide : Entity -&gt; Bool
canRideThisRide entity =
  entity.age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; entity.height &lt; 1.5
```"
30,1546639534.5754,Nery,i mean that's basically what i'm after <@Carman>; i want to define a _vocabulary_
30,1546639550.5763,Timika,It would become an anti-pattern as soon as you have fields that are not used by all kinds of entities and then get a default value that makes no sense.
30,1546639552.5764,Nery,NOT a taxonomy of types
30,1546639559.5765,Carman,I'd say that's the standard way to design structures. As your business rules get more complex you can get fancier to eliminate impossible states
30,1546639584.5768,Nery,ah <@Timika> that seems  a problem; can they just be defaulted to Empty/Null/what-have-you?; Unknown
30,1546639692.5791,Timika,"You could make them `Maybe`s. But I would consider a record with just `Maybe` values an anti-pattern. But as always, you have to make your own trade-offs that make sense to you and the problem you’re trying to solve."
30,1546639715.5797,Nery,yeah i guess my issue is that this seems pretty basic; so i have a sense i'm missing something
30,1546639729.5802,Timika,Could it be that you’re trying to do some game-engine stuff? :slightly_smiling_face:
30,1546639738.5806,Nery,hahaha that would be more fun than what i'm doing; i'm basically just doing business data processing stuff
30,1546639760.5816,Kris,Elm doesn’t have that many language features 
30,1546639766.5819,Nery,"like load a bunch of entities and then render them - basic stuff like that; but to be able to just deal w/ facts like ""age"" and ""height"" seems pretty fundamental
so, since Dicts don't really make this natural, it seems _records_ are the way to go
well, more specifically, a _single_ record like Entity seems the way to go; but then having say 100 fields that are all Maybe doesn't sound right
so i feel like i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place"
30,1546640000.587,Carman,It depends on what the business rules of your system are. Are there some combinations of missing/present data that are invalid?
30,1546640023.5875,Nery,"not necessarily or minimally
after all is just to render; so if a fact isn't present then it just doesn't need to render"
30,1546640069.5886,Carman,"If all the Maybes are independent, it could be that you're just dealing with highly uncertain data"
30,1546640112.59,Nery,well today it's well-known but i'm worried that as new writers want to come into the data system they'll end up breaking my code if i don't make everything Maybe
30,1546640183.5907,Carman,The compiler will tell them if they need to add a Maybe; If all the values are guaranteed to be there today then I wouldn't bring in Maybe
30,1546640226.5915,Nery,they're serving up from back end code (no elm); if i don't make them Maybe.. they could break me overnight; if only i could freeze time... : )
30,1546640308.5931,Carman,"Elm doesn't trust data that comes from APIs. If you're decoding JSON, it will tell you if the data is not in the right shape"
30,1546640389.5949,Timika,That seems to be your core problem. You’re reading data from a source that changes at-will. How could you ever work with data from such a source? This goes way beyond types.
30,1546640433.5954,Nery,"the source has the guarantee that all the facts are of the right type
like age is Int, height is Float, etc...; it just won't guarantee which facts you will get across the board"
30,1546640464.5964,Carman,"Ah, so all the facts are optional in the API?"
30,1546640487.5972,Nery,i'd say if i didn't make that assumption i'd be making myself unnecessarily brittle and easily breakable; like my customers want access to their data in all cases; like if i only have a guy's first name or last name they want to see that; not only see it if i just have his first or last name only (for example)
30,1546640612.5998,Lashawnda,you might want to use a more general data structure then
30,1546640632.6003,Nery,i think that's what i'm looking for @luke; but what is it if it's not a Dict or record(s)
30,1546640666.6012,Lashawnda,then it's time to model it with a custom type :slightly_smiling_face:
30,1546640695.6021,Nery,"but how .. i mean i want something like a heterogenous Dict .. is there a good pattern (ie, custom type) to get that kind of data structure?"
30,1546640698.6022,Timika,The initial idea with a `Dict` and the custom type that encapsulates different types in one type seems one solution.
30,1546640727.6028,Lashawnda,ah yeah that sounds like a good start
30,1546640733.603,Nery,<@Timika> i think you're right that initial pitch you have that's probably my best best; bet; cool i'm going to work with that for a while and see how it plays out; really appreciate the help; &lt;more cakes&gt; : )
30,1546641314.6042,Huong,"So, I think I came up with something"
30,1546641486.6045,Freda,I am quite late to the party but if you haven't already tried that I can recommend the `airbnb` eslint config. It's also opinated but has less weird things like the semi colons in `standard`; <https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb>
30,1546641741.6063,Huong,"<@Lynne> you mentioned wanting to use `Tree.Zipper` with a root-less forest of trees earlier - I realized that it wouldn't be super-hard to make that possible, and it would provide more consistent behaviour for `prepend` and `append`, too, so, here you go: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/zwilias/elm-rosetree/latest/Tree-Zipper#fromForest>"

- given a union type where all tag data have the same extensible record base

35,1546655144.6335,Earnest,I haven't played with anything like that yet but I imagine you'd still need to case match
35,1546655208.6344,Tu,yeah.. it's just a little irritating b/c each branch has the same value
35,1546655278.6355,Earnest,I guess the benefit of the alias is that you don't have to case match until you get to the `MyType` specific fields. Like `type MyType = MyS { stringSpecificField : String } | MyI { intSpecificField : Int }`; along with the above `ButThis` type. then you can access shared fields normally but have to case when you get to the `MyType` fields
35,1546655557.6387,Tu,"interesting — but i don't think you can make a `List ButThis a`, can you? as soon as you try to, say, create a literal instance `[ {field = ""asdf"", intField = 1}, {field = ""wert"", floatField = 2.0}]`, the compiler will :face_vomiting:"
35,1546655640.6399,Earnest,"No it'd be more like:
```
myList = 
  [ { someField = ""9001"",  fieldType = IntField 1 }
  , { someField = ""42"", fieldType = FloatField 2.0 }
  ]
```; So you encode the differences in it's own type, and then that type can be a field of the more general record"

39,1546692528.6493,Huong,"Yeah, changed how a zipper is modeled so it keeps track of siblings of the current focus, rather than having the siblings be part of the ""breadcrumbs"", which enables having siblings without a parent at the ""root"" level"

54,1546898136.7332,Floy,"Hi folks, is there any working implementation of a global model (i.e. store a.k.a. redux) for Elm? I've been wondering a lot about it, couldn't exactly spot anything out there, after being repeatedly asked for something like that for my project?; pretty much, I don't see much of a problem with writing huge model for all my domain object, but I am terrified with  dealing with any associations that are out there and keeping them in sync; <@Rosa> if you don't mind responding here, so I can easily spot this thread later on"
54,1546898455.7343,Rosa,i feel like you _could_ just pass it around as an argument.
53,1546898643.7346,Earlean,Can you be more specific about your question? An Elm app has a single model value that hold all the state of your application. (redux got the idea from Elm) 
54,1546898711.735,Earlean,What are 'associations' in this context and why do you think they would be a problem to keep in sync?
54,1546898761.7358,Cammy,It sounds an awful lot like you’re describing the Elm Architecture itself (which redux is an implementation of). 
54,1546898779.736,Rosa,"elm spa exmple i think used to have a `Session` object which is almost (smells like ) a `Model`. and then each Page had its own `Model`, and could “sync” data with `Session`"
54,1546898800.7362,Floy,"so let's say my model looks like:

```
type alias Store = {
   students: List Student
   classes: List Classes
}

type alias Student = {
   classes: List Classes  --- or should it be List Classes.Id
}
```"
54,1546898812.7365,Rosa,"for like caching, auth, and stuff"
54,1546898899.7368,Floy,"<@Earlean> the question is if I know change one of the classes that change will not be reflected in each student record that is associated/participates in given classes?; as everything is stored ""as value""?; or am I fundamentally wrong, now :thinking_face: ?"
54,1546898962.7374,Rosa,"btw Richard just gave a rad talk on keeping things in sync
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OdemxhfbU>

even used Students and Classes for examples"
54,1546898978.7376,Floy,"awesome, will definitely watch it !; apart from that, I assume that easiest way to handle association would be to store associations via IDs (UUIDs) and simply pull'em from the store for render purposes; ?"
54,1546899260.7384,Earlean,<@Floy> you should store the values once and store IDs to refer to them
54,1546899528.7387,Floy,"so will my assumption be correct that in order to correctly handle, let's say `delete`, I ought to have dedicated functions to know exactly what to delete (class) and where (classId in all students)?; yeah, I think this might be correct answer"
54,1546900155.7392,Earlean,You can certainly do that. But invalid IDs are fine to have.
54,1546900221.7394,Floy,"if you have time, I wonder about one extra thing - will I be correct to assume that each view wouldn't exactly store the model (i.e. copy or ""lens"" of the store). I should pass that to view/update only and maybe just have some convenient function to materialize slice of the store for view purposes?; i.e. `viewStudent : Store -&gt; List StudentView` ?"
54,1546900459.7398,Earlean,"Yep, that's a common strategy"
54,1546900864.74,Floy,":+1:; ok, I will try to find time and build something against those recommendations, if I may call them so; thx a lot for quick chat"
55,1546913517.7417,Marcus,"Is it possible to do something like this: `user = { model.user | firstName = ""John"" }`? My intuition says it should be, but my compiler says it is not.; Feels more succinct to do it that way than to break out `model.user` as an intermediate variable, which works."
56,1546914665.7426,Lizabeth,"```
user = model.user |&gt; \u -&gt; { u | firstName = ""John"" }
```

I’ve seen someone suggest this before."
55,1546915174.7428,Marcus,"Ah, not a bad approach. Thanks.; I'm wondering if there is a more idiomatic way to do what I'm doing below. This is one of the case statements in my update function:

```
NewName name -&gt;
    let
        newModel = { model | name = newName }
    in
    ( newModel
    , persistModel newModel
    )
```

I have this pattern a lot, where I create an intermediate variable for the model, then return that and a command that uses is.; I guess I could do something like:

```
{ model | name = newName }
|&gt; (\m -&gt; (m, persistModel m))
```

That doesn't really feel much clearer though."
57,1546918449.7477,Ruthann,what does `persistModel` do?; i ask because the name implies it's doing something you're already doing by returning `newModel` in the first part of the tuple
57,1546918565.7493,Marcus,"I simplified the actual code so it isn't domain specific. In my case, it passes the model to an API.; e.g., for backend storage"
57,1546918667.7502,Ruthann,"ic and returning `newModel` would be a sort of 'optimistic update' in that case; in theory, that looks fine to me, you're updating your model locally (temp) and sending it away (perm)
we do this in places as well. the only other thing i could see is if you only updated your local model when the backend task returned with the true state of the backend after the save"
57,1546918816.7526,Marcus,"It's strictly fire-and-forget. I wasn't crazy about always creating the intermediate variable to hold the updated model, but I don't think there's a better way."
57,1546918861.7532,Ruthann,"if you just want it to look cleaner:
```
{ model | name = newName }
  |&gt; (,)
  |&gt; Tuple.mapSecond persistModel
```; we use pipes `|&gt;` *a lot* in our code, it doesn't always lead to more readable code so up to you to judge"
57,1546918975.7552,Marcus,"The majority of the team is new to FP, so I'll probably stick with the intermediate variable over the pipes. Although, we could stand to embrace pipes more.; Can you explain the line `|&gt; (,)`?"
57,1546918995.756,Ruthann,"hum... actually i don't think that'll work `(,) : a -&gt; b -&gt; (a,b)` your anonymous function is better; i definitely found that pipes or too much transformations was a barrier to onboarding; ppl tended to hold the whole type in their heads rather than just looking at each transform in turn, or not being able to see the input/output straight away"
57,1546919074.758,Marcus,"It's an awesome idiom, but an unfamiliar syntax.; We'll get there."
58,1546935882.7596,Velia,"Why not make your `persistModel` function return the tuple?
```
persistModel : Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
```
then
```
{ model | name = newName }
    |&gt; persistModel
```
or just
```
persistModel { model | name = newName }
```

An alternative is to make your anonymous function a generic one, maybe something like:
```
thenDo : (Model -&gt; Cmd msg) -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd msg)
thenDo f model =
    (model, f model)
```
then
```
{ model | name = newName }
    |&gt; thenDo persistModel
```
Or if you want to keep the tuple structure more visible:
```
apply : (a, a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a, b)
apply (a, f) = (a, f a)
```
then
```
    apply
        ( { model | name = newName }
        , persistModel
        )

59,1546937848.7627,Raymonde,"Hi folks, any good idea to cache http requests? I mean cache the GET request with url and params, so that next time fetch with same url and params, it should not trigger the request.; It should apply to all requests through the app."
59,1546938067.7645,Nana,"<@Raymonde> I was thinking about this too
you could just use a Dict with the entire url as key I guess; (or the relavant part of the url)"
59,1546938186.7657,Raymonde,"Seems I have to store this Dict in global model, and pass all the way down where there is request command."
59,1546938215.7659,Nana,yup
59,1546938263.7662,Raymonde,"I’ll think about it, thanks."
59,1546938527.7668,Lewis,won't the browser do this for you “for free” if the http server responds with caching headers?
59,1546938566.7672,Nana,<@Lewis> not when getting things through scripts I think?
59,1546938578.7674,Lewis,ah. ok.
60,1546939552.7696,Lynne,"Is it an intended/documented behaviour to not using cache when requesting data from scripts? It is plain old HTTP after all. Here, for example, it is said that resources downloaded through fetch are subject to the HTTP cache: <https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/referrer-and-cache-control-apis-for-fetch/>"
60,1546939949.7715,Bert,XHR requests do adhere to the normal HTTP caching too. ; You need to set no-cache headers for GET requests when you want to bypass the cache. ; Which incidentally many times is what you want when dealing with an API. 
60,1546940099.7752,Lynne,And backend can be set up to prevent same requests from being sent by setting some response headers
60,1546940768.7756,Nana,ah I see :sweat_smile:
60,1546941133.7768,Raymonde,"Is that means it doesn’t need to cache the requests in model, if set cache control correctly?"
60,1546941157.7772,Lynne,"Yes, that's how it is supposed to be done if you control both frontend and backend; The question is, however, if Elm's HTTP implementation allows to NOT set no-cache headers - it may be hardcoded; As <@Bert> mentioned many times when you dealing with API you want to bypass the cache"
60,1546941570.7807,Raymonde,"Alright, I checked the api in my app, and noticed there is a request header `cache-control: no-cache`. According to the article you post, I can set cache mode to `force-cache`"
60,1546941610.7816,Bert,There are no headers in `elm/http` requests by default.
60,1546941630.7822,Raymonde,But I don’t see a place to set cache mode with elm/http
60,1546941679.7829,Lynne,`Http.request` accepts `headers` as a record field; Please also note that setting up cache is not limited only to `cache-control` header. There are few other headers which needs to be set up in request and response for caching to be reliable.
60,1546941834.7852,Raymonde,"Ah, that seems many things to concern."
60,1546941876.7857,Lynne,"It is not that complicated but, yes, it does require some learning; Some server-side frameworks make it easy by taking single configuration option and then setting up responses for you. So you might want to check docs for whatever is on your backend."
60,1546942116.7875,Raymonde,"I only control our frontend, I’ll learn http cache first. Thanks."
61,1546944883.7896,Nana,"btw, something that's puzzled me a bit is all the talk about using Service Workers for caching
they always seem to treat caching as something completely new, never mentioning the traditional HTTP caching"
61,1546945071.7901,Danika,"service workers offer much more granular control over what and when resources are cached; <https://code.fb.com/web/web-performance-cache-efficiency-exercise/> here’s an interesting internal study at facebook; &gt; After a few weeks of collecting data and letting caches fill up, we looked back over the past seven days’ worth of data. The initial results were surprising to us: 25.5% of all logged requests were missing the cache. We split the data by interface, desktop and mobile, and still saw the same breakdown: 24.8% of desktop requests and 26.9% of mobile were missing the cached image. Not what we expected, so we dug in more.; This is with standard HTTP caches"
61,1546945580.7918,Nana,hmm are they saying that 25% should have had the image cached but didn't? or is it just that 25% hadn't seen the image before?
61,1546945688.792,Danika,Should’ve been cached
61,1546945800.793,Nana,why would that be though? because the browser decided to free up the harddrive space?
61,1546945834.7933,Danika,Browsers ultimately discard the cache when they feel like it.
61,1546945848.7937,Nana,"like, surely it's not just ""HTTP caching is buggy and fails 20% of the time"""
61,1546945883.7944,Danika,"Yes, its not that HTTP caching is *necessarily* the evil one, but its more that browsers treat service worker cache and HTTP cache differently; <https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/> this article is getting a bit on the old side now, but using service worker and http cache in tandem is a reasonable strategy"
61,1546945951.796,Nana,"just seems weird to use service workers for something such basic things, and especially for Google to promote it. couldn't they just change the browser settings?; or is it that too many websites are telling the browser to cache things, so you should use Service Workers to tell the browser you *really* want to cache it?"
61,1546946466.7986,Danika,"I mean ultimately service workers and http caches are for different things, right.

You http cache to save redownloading assets that havent changed. But service workers power PWAs which should/need to function like native apps. The expectation is different: pwas need to be functional offline but a cached website doesn’t offer the same assurance."
62,1546957799.7999,Bert,"Service Workers can be used to make the app run and have content offline. ; Oh, I didn't see the newest message. Yes! "

63,1546961710.8063,Quintin,"I agree with the premise that css and app ui is not really a great match, but looking at the docs, I still get the feeling that elm-ui doesnt entirely replace elm-css  :disappointed:; but I might be missing something"

63,1546962701.809,Quintin,"<@Desire> Im still looking at the docs, but out of the box, im missing how to deal with desktop/mobile components (media queries) and animations/transitions, I might be missing something ofc :smile: And thanks for the channel tip, I had no idea it existed"
64,1546962811.8098,Desire,animatons are in a different package; and media queries are supported afaik

64,1546963463.8146,Danika,"That’s a shame, that is what i was asking yes"
64,1546963499.815,Agustin,Theres at least one package that ships as a npm + elm package; Where the npm package generates ports for the elm package

64,1546963714.8175,Alana,"(which is awesome, btw)"
64,1546963898.8176,Danika,Ah cool so you basically just ask politely for developers to define the ports themselves (or supply different port names to the js portion of the library).
64,1546964355.8181,Agustin,"This was the package I was thinking of <https://github.com/billstclair/elm-websocket-client>; But its a copy and paste job, I thought someone was talking about adding a generator"

64,1546965905.8209,Agustin,"If you find something that works well, you might be able to ask for an elm-explorations repo; That allows native code as experimental packages; I have no idea what the process is though"

68,1546984692.8413,Theda,"This definitely looks like something I’d use.

One use case I had with a component that this wouldn’t work for though:
I have what I call a “SuperSelect” component which is basically just an autocomplete. One need I had while making it was the `update` function of the component, in addition to returning it’s `model` and `cmd` also returned the third option of `maybe Option` (option being an internal type for the selected autocomplete option) which was the previously selected, or just then selected option based on logic that occurred inside the component’s update function; I think I can actually work around that though"
68,1546985812.8425,Leoma,<@Theda> this is what the external message functionality is for.; It’s there. Unless I’ve misunderstood your requirements.
68,1546986118.8434,Theda,"So in this case an option can be selected for a large number of reasons.

1. The input loses focus but there was a “hovered” option by arrow key navigation. `OnBlur`
2. The user clicks on an option from the autocomplete dropdown. `OnClick optionIndex`
3. The user navigates the options via arrow keys and hits “enter” to select `OnKeyPress` subscription.

So three different messages can result in this change and the consumer would have to watch for every one"
68,1546986491.8437,Leoma,"Right, so I’n my example, my TextEditorComponent can signal that a value was accepted, or reverted: <https://github.com/z5h/component-result/blob/master/examples/src/TextEditorComponent.elm#L31>

69,1546991090.8506,Earnest,"you're only exporting the `TailwindClass` type, not the `TailwindClass` constructor; to export all the tags/constructors you'd need to do something like `exposing (TailwindClass(..))`"

69,1546991168.8512,Earnest,"Or add a function like `fromTailwindClass : TailwindClass -&gt; String`, depending on if you want consumers to be able to create their own TailwindClass or not; Just exposing the type &amp; function means people can pull values out, but not make their own.

69,1546991251.8516,Leopoldo,"ok...; <@Earnest> apart from `exposing (TailwindClass(..))` do i add something else again?; ```I do not see `absolute` in the `exposing` list, but it is in your module

72,1546994268.8531,Sofia,"I've got an odd challenge; I'm trying to create a text box that automatically replaces characters as the user types. Imagine essentially typing `gamma` and after you hit space, the `gamma` becomes `ɣ`; I'd like to keep the cursor in the same place as well as set the value on the input box with the new value.; If I use an unkeyed `Html.input`, the cursor doesn't change positions unless the value is explicitly changed; imagine that the cursor is always set to 0 in the dom -- the dom ignores it since it never changes.
```
Html.input
                [ HtmlA.type_ ""text""
                , HtmlA.value replacedString
                , HtmlA.selectionStart inputBox.input.caret

          )
        ]
 
```; If I use a keyed Html.input where the key changes every time the input changes, then the dom node gets recreated over and over which leads to the mobile keyboard quickly closing and reopening and keystrokes being dropped.; Is there a good way to do this kind of auto-replace in textboxes in elm?"
73,1546999077.8577,Earnest,"not sure on that one, looks like it's in both..."
72,1547004365.8653,Augustus,"<@Sofia> we ran into a similar problem with supporting `@mentions` in a comment area, You could do it through ports with something like <https://stackoverflow.com/a/512542> and either put the cursor to the end of the input (with another port), or use a subscription that keeps track of the current cursor position and restore it to where it was."
73,1547004402.8662,Augustus,"if it needs to be more complex than that I would recommend using another library like Quill and wrapping it in a custom element, you have a lot more control and easier cross-browser support with it than rolling your own"

75,1547020240.8681,Leopoldo,great news~! <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/afidegnum/elm-tailwind/latest/>; can you try this ? <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/afidegnum/elm-tailwind/latest/>; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/afidegnum/elm-tailwind/latest>
75,1547023571.871,Dorsey,"<@Leopoldo> I think <@Bailey> is asking about a general purpose tool, for any CSS, not a specific framework. I don't know of any, but depending on your case simple search and replace with regular expressions could work. Something like: replace `/(.+?)\:(.+?);/` to `Html.Attributes.style ""$1"" ""$2"" ,`."

77,1547028033.8742,Lynn,"in elm 0.18 is there a way to get the entire hash part of the location. I naively tried to use
```
tokenParser =
    Url.custom ""TOKEN""
        (\urlString -&gt; Debug.log """" urlString .....

and all I ever get is the string up to the first `/` in my hash rather than the whole thing; (we’ve inherited some hash routing)"
77,1547029946.8764,Huong,"<@Lynn> when using `parsePath`, the parser is run on the path, when using parseHash, it only ever sees the hash. To mix, I'd try pass the `hash` as a parameter to the parser manually, so ```toRoute : Location -&gt; Maybe Route
toRoute location =
  UrlParser.parsePath (myParser location.hash) location```"
75,1547029978.8767,Huong,or something like that
77,1547030264.8773,Lynn,so I am using parseHash at present but let me play around with your suggestion
75,1547030369.879,Huong,"ohh, okay, so you want ""the rest of the url"" so to speak. There's no built-in way to do that at present - passing it as a parameter is the easiest way, the alternative is to build a sort of recursive, depth-limited parser, but that tends to get slow and ugly"
77,1547030418.8794,Lynn,perhaps an example would help; if I have `<http://localhost:3000/#edit/nestedQueries/P5-ZypUo#token=23456>` (which I know is ugly); I want `#edit/nestedQueries/P5-ZypUo#token=23456`; or perhaps without the first `#`; what I get is `edit` and none of what follows the `/`
78,1547032411.8816,Emilee,"is there an elm library that parses urls, and accepts urls that have no scheme?; i'm trying to sanitize form input, and at first I used a premade regex to check urls (which did not work well *at all*), then I tried `elm/url`, but the problem here is that it only accepts urls with a scheme; seems `elm/url` is not a great choice for this usecase anyway since it also accepts more urls than i want ( `<https://asdf>` for example is a valid url, but I don't want it to be accepted by my form because it doesn't have a tld)"
77,1547038522.8854,Huong,"<@Lynn> I _think_ that would all be in `location.hash`. Which you have access to _outside_ your urlParser, so it can be passed along as a param"

80,1547071189.8945,Jenice,"Turning off the debugger does fix it, but I personally find the debugger so invaluable when developing it makes life really really difficult; I could probably live with it though, if I heard something anything about if this is actually in the pipeline to be fixed or not?; I understand the reasoning for not talking too publicly about new features or releases but this is a bug with the existing release and it is causing a lot of people problems, and those are just the ones that come on the slack here and report it. For a language which is so wonderfully friendly to new users, being confronted with an unsolvable Haskell error seems like a real shame to me"

84,1547104160.0052,Floy,"hey folks, another thing that is quite interesting thing.
recently we've got request to improve performance of the views and I am trying to hard to come up with the model that would allow to me safely implement new approach. Let's maybe start off with requirements. There are 2 distinct requests per ""groupId"" that I have to execute. One must finish successfully in order to even display the data and second request is auxiliary to provide user some context data out of the associations from object in first request. Also, number of ""groupIds"" for each I execute those 2 requests should be considered infinite (i..e there can be 1 but also 10). Not to mention that objects that must resolve have to be coupled with user-inputs-ish props

a.k.a -&gt; `type alias ServerData = {obj: Obj, changeRequest, }`, where `obj` is the server response and `changeRequest` is sth to allow user to interact with it.

so now I have this auxiliary data, let's call it `ObjDetails` that is fetched for the same `groupId` from another endpoint that may fail but it will not fail everything. That means that I am targeting sth along ``type alias ServerData = {obj: Obj, changeRequest, details; ObjDetails}`.

I cannot exactly wrap my head around those facts:
1. I cannot use `Task` because I need both requests per `groupId` to resolve without killing each other (i,e, one fails). I assume if I could've that would simplify a lot
2. I have troubles figuring how to safely pull information from second request result. I assume that trying to do that withing `update` is not exactly a nice idea as there are two distinct messages per `groupId` and actually response from either of requests is stored inside the main models dictionaries where keys are `groupId`. So I guess it has to be done within `view` a.k.a. gluing all things up together

Basically, I hope that with this description you might be able to pin point of relate to own business cases and how you resolved them

BTW. Associations are represnted via ids and there is no way to fetch full blown object (i.e. one request per `groupid`; if you have any tips, let's take it over in this thread
thx in advance"
85,1547106760.0055,Lynne,Hey there; Quite an interesting intro :slightly_smiling_face:
85,1547106839.0059,Floy,I wanted to be thorough :stuck_out_tongue:
85,1547106848.0061,Lynne,"So, you are saying you can't use tasks because you need both requests to resolve without killing each other; Where does information about tasks killing each other originate from?; Tasks themselves are independent entities"
85,1547106890.0067,Floy,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Task#map2>; Note in there; or is it like that `map2` fails if and only if the first one fails; ?
85,1547106931.0076,Lynne,"No, if either; But it just means you can't use `map2` :slightly_smiling_face:; Which is far less strickter"
85,1547106957.0083,Floy,what would you use?
85,1547106980.0085,Lynne,"I would just fire two separate tasks, let them come with results and store these results in two separate `Dict`s"
85,1547106992.0087,Floy,that's what I have right now in the model; the problem is combining both
85,1547107023.0093,Lynne,"I see, let me grasp a little more on the intro then; You could actually look into `andThen` btw; If I understand correctly first request must complete (meaning if it does not, you are not even interested in firing the second one)"
85,1547107100.0099,Floy,everything is also a bit complicated by a fact that those aforementioned `details` are in fact `Maybe`. Meaning my  object from first request says `detailsId: Maybe DetailsId` :stuck_out_tongue:
85,1547107102.0101,Lynne,But it will mean that requests will not be asynchronous
85,1547107131.0103,Floy,"given the volume of data I need to handle there, I am trying to stay away that fact"
85,1547107151.0105,Lynne,Do you mean you need things to run asynchronously?
85,1547107175.0108,Floy,"those literally can't be synchronous and given the underlying data source I cannot exactly expect paging now, maybe in future - still I need to address performance issues :confused:"
85,1547107192.011,Lynne,"Well, let's focus on present then; Ok, then, yes, combining tasks won't work. Actually `map2` is also running tasks synchronously, so that's another reason why it is not suitable"
85,1547107321.0114,Floy,exactly so
85,1547107373.0116,Lynne,"I think I have pretty much similar situation in my app actually. I need to load data from two sources and only when it is there I can initialize a component. In your case it means you don't have to wait for the second source probably and can render as soon as you get `Obj`; So actually you can combine stuff in `update` and to solve performance issues you have to I think; That's how I addressed it:
```
type ModelState
    = NotInitialized
    | Initializing (Maybe x) (Maybe y)
    | Initialized (x, y)
```"
85,1547107457.0122,Floy,is it considered a good practice/solution? I mean I will need to have two separate messages for that?
85,1547107476.0124,Lynne,So if you had a `Dict GroupId (ModelState Obj ObjDetails)` you could populate it with correct `ModelState`s; Having two separate messages is unavoidable I think; You basically run two things in parallel and don't know when either of them completes; How else would you address t his? There has to be a point somewhere to wait and combine the results. That's what `update` is for.
85,1547107544.0132,Floy,"yeah, I see what you mean here"
85,1547107571.0134,Lynne,Do you have performance problems in views?
85,1547107580.0136,Floy,"well, honestly speaking that is the most difficult challenge that I had to face here :slightly_smiling_face:"
85,1547107583.0138,Lynne,I mean are they slow/sluggish?
85,1547107664.0141,Floy,"they kind of are, but bigger issue is on backend side that even after receiving a load of performance improvements may still get killed given that can be bombarded with thousands of new request for each object resolved from 1st request to get those details one by one :smile:"
85,1547107737.0143,Lynne,Can you batch these requests?; Would it help?
85,1547107753.0147,Floy,"as to why that happened, I can't exactly say, I assume that everyone is guilty here :stuck_out_tongue:; you mean sending batch request? it's a neat idea, but backend does not exactly support that"
85,1547107786.0151,Lynne,"Ok, you can't :slightly_smiling_face:; But I think that would be a way to go"
85,1547107801.0155,Floy,not to mentioon that it would present another challange in Elm as to parsing the response for that :smile:
85,1547107821.0157,Lynne,It would be a list/dict of same decoders you use for the single message; easy-peasy; :stuck_out_tongue:
85,1547107839.0163,Floy,"hmm....ok, my bad :smile:"

you can use `case model of` and match on `Foo1 bar _ -&gt;`, but I am unable to match on it like this `foo bar _ -&gt;` in order to be able to construct the right foo back. I’m thinking that the way to is to wrap the `Foo` in another constructor, like:

I am curious... say I wanted to learn moder js by porting my demo. What would that entail? Where would I even start? What kind of things would I have to learn. I appreciate elm because it guided me into accomplishing the demo with little web programming experience: it told me to build a model, a way to update it, and a view. I did those three things and magically had a useful demo for class. How do I even get started doing something similar in js?; More specific questions:
I know elm uses something called a vdom... would I need something like that in js land... or could I forgo it?"

93,1547147558.0563,Jospeh,Vue and React are programming languages? Or are they equivalent to TEA?
93,1547147613.0565,Nana,"the are frameworks/libs for JS, but they use ""functional rendering"" similar to Elm"
93,1547147615.0567,Jospeh,Never mind! I googled... make sense... so I would still use something to guide me through the process instead of just starting js from scratch...
93,1547147615.0569,Rosa,Vue and REact are js librarires

`replaceAlias : Decoder a -&gt; (String, String) -&gt; Decoder a`

94,1547149299.0626,Carman,I'm not sure what you're trying to do?
94,1547149339.064,Shawanna,It's a pretty gross workaround to get dillonkearns/elm-graphql working with a finicky backend
94,1547149353.0644,Carman,"You have something like `Decode.field ""name"" Decode.string` and you'd like to change it to read from `""email""` instead?"
94,1547149359.0646,Shawanna,yeah; but without actually changing the decoder; since it's autogenerated code
94,1547149593.0658,Carman,Can you define a different decoder that reads from the correct field and use that instead?
94,1547149642.0664,Shawanna,"Unfortunately that won't work when the server-side GraphQL schema changes and we need to regenerate code; The required change is predictable, but the only way I can see to really handle it now is to get a string body back, do the substitution, and then continue"
94,1547149958.0683,Carman,What about modifying the code-gen script to do a find-and-replace at the very end?
94,1547149980.0686,Shawanna,"that would end up breaking it for other, correct, backends; I could do that and then just have two sets of generated code"
94,1547150259.072,Carman,"hmmm maybe your find-and-replace could do something a bit fancier like turning `field ""name"" string` into `oneOf [field ""name"" string, field ""email"" string]` ?"
94,1547150329.0731,Shawanna,"ahh, yeah, that's a good idea"
94,1547150487.0756,Sade,"<@Carman> hey there! For reference, here is the issue <@Shawanna> is talking about: <https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/issues/106>. It's a bit hard to describe concisely. But basically there is this strange clause in the GraphQL Spec that declares certain perfectly unambiguous queries to be invalid: <https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#example-54e3d>

Some GraphQL team members were nice enough to describe the rationale, which is basically that they wanted to eliminate a case where, say, a Java GraphQL code generator would have a clash of two fields with the same name but different types. So they made them invalid.

All the relevant details are linked to in that issue. Like I said, pretty complicated so it's a bit hard to describe it concisely!"
94,1547150592.0783,Shawanna,"Hey <@Sade>. It turns out for my case, the only alias that really matters is the alias of the actual mutation operation, so I've got a pretty dirty way of stripping it, now I'm just looking to add it back in on completion, since I can guarantee there will never be a need for it.; Hence the idea of renaming a field in the decode pipeline"
94,1547150704.0798,Sade,"The unfortunate thing is that it seems like a couple of frameworks don't handle valid GraphQL queries correctly when they have valid (but unusual) field aliases like this:

```
{
  search(query: ""Elm"") {
    ...on Repo {
      aliasForStringId: id
    }
    ...on Issue {
      aliasForIntId: id
    }
  }
}
```; ^ And by the way, this is exactly the case where you need a field alias to ensure that this query is valid (even though it would be unambiguous without the aliases). But since in practice field aliases are rarely used, some frameworks have bugs around them :confused:"
94,1547150776.081,Shawanna,"Yeah, it's an unfortunate intersection of little used edge cases; AppSync handles the spec correctly (I think), it just fails to automagically trigger the subscription event unless a mutation matches exactly by name. Hence, I only need to strip that alias, then I can parse the result w/ field aliases no-problem"
94,1547150847.0827,Sade,"&gt; It turns out for my case, the only alias that really matters is the alias of the actual mutation operation
<@Shawanna> I'm not sure I'm following, could you clarify with an example maybe?"
94,1547150853.0829,Shawanna,"Sure; Here's an example subscription
```
subscription {
  showStartedAt {
    showState3523593770: showState
    comedians2741155849: comedians
    time3832528868: time
    date3832528868: date
  }
}
```; That gets wired up in AppSync so that it automatically triggers on a specific mutation; So when I send a mutation like this:
```
mutation {
  startShow3832717217: startShow(date: ""2019-02-02"", time: ""02:00 pm"") {
    showState3523593770: showState
    comedians2741155849: comedians
    time3832528868: time
    date3832528868: date
  }
}
```; It should trigger it, but doesn't, because of the `startShow3832717217` alias; So, if I strip that alias, send the response, and then add it back in, everything lines up; I just realized I may be able to use the alias in the AppSync GraphQL annotations that specify the wiring, but I'll have to test it"
94,1547151034.0875,Sade,"Ah, okay, it's very helpful to see the specific example, thanks for that <@Shawanna>!

So this is actually a totally different use case then. This doesn't have to do with that corner-case of the GraphQL Spec that I was describing. This is actually something that `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` does in order to ensure that you don't have clashing fields if you query the same thing multiple times."
94,1547151035.0876,Shawanna,That'd certainly make things simpler; yes; The feature makes 100% sense
94,1547151154.0897,Sade,"Yeah, totally, the aliasing is all valid according to the GraphQL spec. The only reason I bring it up is because this one is actually harder to find a way to remove. Because say you had multiple calls to `startShow` in your `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` query which each have different arguments... then you would need the hashed aliases that it uses (based on the arguments passed in).; So anyway, there's not really anything that can be done to remove that. As I describe in <https://medium.com/@dillonkearns/how-elm-guides-towards-simplicity-3d34685dc33c>"
94,1547151281.0922,Shawanna,"Agreed. I happen to know that, in my use-case, that won't ever be a concern, so I copied only the `Graphql.Http` part of `elm-graphql` into my project and rework `toReadyRequest` to strip the alias and capture it's name for later re-insertion; I'd been hoping to write something that could generally transform a `Decoder` to rename a field, but looking at the source for `Json.Decode` it doesn't seem likely; It's a fragile approach, unfortunately"
94,1547151374.0944,Sade,"Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that tweaking Json.Decode would be a fruitful path. But copying the code into `vendor` in your project wouldn't be too terrible. Obviously it's far from ideal, but it should do the trick."
94,1547151392.0951,Shawanna,"In any case, I think I just found an AWS side work-around"
94,1547151398.0952,Sade,"The good news is that there's really just a single pinch point for determining the alias names. So all you need to do is tweak that any time you pull down updated source code.; Oh, good!"
94,1547151466.0964,Shawanna,"If your curious, basically in my mutation schema I just define a dummy operation:
```
type Mutation {
	startShow(date: String!, time: String!): Show!
	startShow3832717217(date: String!, time: String!): Show!
}
```

And wire the annotation to both of them, then it ends up routing things correctly; Since the usage pattern is simple that isn't too painful to keep track of; Thanks for the help <@Sade> and <@Carman>"
94,1547151664.0978,Sade,"Oh my! Well, whatever gets the job done, I suppose! :man-shrugging:  Glad you found a solution. Would you mind posting that on the Github issue when you get a chance?"
94,1547152289.0989,Shawanna,"Ahh dang, nevermind. I'm dumb and didn't consider the hashing was on data, not just keys. Ok, back to the hacky plan then"
95,1547157328.1015,Santina,"Anyone have some pointers on how I might use `elm/parser` to parse a string like ""45.4.5.6"", where the first number must be between 1-64, and the numbers following the first (4.5.6) are optional but the values of which must be within the range of 1-6?"
95,1547157758.1019,Virgie,"<@Santina> roughly

1. Decode an integer with `int`
2. use `Decode.andThen` to get access to the parsed value
3. validate

```
<http://Parser.int|Parser.int> |&gt; Parser.andThen (\value -&gt; 
    if value &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 64 then

4. use `Parser.loop` to parse the optional final digits. This decoder will probably use `chompIf` a bunch.
5. put it all together"

99,1547190039.1186,Lashawnda,there's no established milestone for what 1.0 means for elm; when we need to argue the degree to which elm is production ready we usually do so in terms of the abundance of cases where elm is successfully being used in production

104,1547208453.1361,Danika,A contributor to what?
104,1547208496.1367,Liza,`elm-community/*` `elm-explorations/*` `elm/*`
104,1547208775.1386,Elyse,"<@Ashton> could you give an example how to create such Id User for instance?
Is it something like the following?
```
userId: String -&gt; Id User

104,1547208808.1391,Danika,"&gt; So in 0.19 only the elm-lang and elm-explorations organizations can compile and publish kernel code or effect managers. It *will not be available in applications* or other packages. I hope the history I wrote, and the posts here 303 and here 214 clarify the design trade-offs that went into this.

I believe the intention is for lang/explorations to eventually drop kernel code all together. Although presumably there is some mechanism built into the language to allow those developers to actually work on those packages… A private fork perhaps?

In any case the kernel code always lives in `src/Elm/Kernel/yourJsHere.js` so try it and see what the compiler shouts about I guess."
104,1547208976.1403,Liza,"based on what i sow - your package also must have some magic organization stuff, an as i know `elm-lang` and `elm-explorations` is hardcoded into compielier; so - sounds like some “little” magic how to compile it, and then link it as dependency..; and looking into how JS looks… it is not really pleasure work"
104,1547209500.1434,Danika,"Although I disagree with the basic premise, the point is you’re not supposed to be writing kernel code in your elm apps. It was never a supported feature for users, just an undocumented api designed just for core. If it works for lang/explorations then there _will_ be a way to get it to work locally, but it’s not a useful or productive “learning” process because there will eventually be no kernel code left to write.; It’s not a pleasure to work, because it’s a hack until WebAssembly support is complete; There are other front end fp langs that offer upfront js support, but elm is not one of them"
104,1547209774.1454,Nana,<@Danika> so it's the intention that all kernel code from elm-explorations will eventually be merged into core I guess?
104,1547209803.1459,Danika,"As I understand, the intention is there will be no kernel code at all eventually"
104,1547210363.1467,Agustin,<@Danika> I believe <@Liza> is asking how to work on elm core locally; Rather than publishing native JS

104,1547210646.1552,Liza,"and there is also other part of “elm” that is compiler - that stuff lives in haskell, so that can be “easy”  compiled by anyone who knows how haskell tooling works (btw kind of readable / hackable), but to work with “native modules” for people like me (more than 15y exp in JS) is kind of challenge"

104,1547230980.1812,Ashton,"Yeah <@Cora>, you just lock in certain functions to certain types by making the `a` in the type signature what every you want. But you can also do things like lock in consistency. Like for example:
```
getById : Id a -&gt; Dict String a -&gt; Maybe a
getById id dict =
    Dict (Id.toString id) dict
```
You can use `getById` for any `a`, but it _must_ be the same `a` as the one in the `Id a`.; Does that make sense? All you have to do is make the type signature `Id User` and is it an `Id User`, and thereafter it cannot be anything else. All it takes is making the type signature that to start with, and then from then on out through out your program theres type safety."
110,1547233988.1846,Gale,Do people usually end up using webpack with Elm in production stacks or are elm make and reactor enough?

104,1547234048.1847,Nana,<@Ashton> although if `User` is a type alias you are then relying on duck typing :thinking_face: probably a pretty silly concern though
110,1547234145.185,Agustin,Im using webpack; And I’m not the only one; But its not used “in production” its just building for netlify in my case
110,1547234278.1868,Gale,Yeah - seems like it might be the default - but I'm wondering if build/ compile with webpack is always necessary with teams using Elm or if it's just a habit.
110,1547234325.1878,Agustin,Its by no means a default!; Remember that elm doesn’t minify or bundle assets
110,1547234342.1888,Gale,I'm unsure whether Elm tooling is designed (or aimed towards) being able to support production project builds on it's own or whether it is assumed that people will use webpack.
110,1547234352.189,Nana,and things like your `getById` example probably provide more safety than what you lose from the duck typing
110,1547234455.1911,Gale,So in my upgrade I'm coming across people saying optimize won't work with uglify and things like that. I guess I'm trying to find out what the 'standard/ preferred' method is for bundling assets mostly at this point. My app is small and I'm not too bothered with the minify part.; I had a thought that webpack was maybe over-complicating things for my project (since it's the last hurdle for my 0.19 upgrade). <@Agustin> Thanks for your comments.

```
type alias User =

type User

104,1547240199.1987,Ashton,"Yeah Ive run into that recursive type problem. Ive never done your solution <@Nana>, but it seems like a good one. Instead I just try not to put ids _inside_ the thing they are an `Id` of, and instead use lots of `(Id User, User)`. Another, however less ideal solution Ive done is:
```
type UserId = UserId

type alis User =

112,1547253859.2071,Daria,"<@Earlean> thanks, we’re using Browser.application and indeed it seems clearing the child nodes was the culprit I was looking for as the js elements used “document.body.appendChild(script);” internally"

<https://github.com/tmikeschu/see-fp>

I am trying to figure out how to model the different functions that could be passed to, for example, a map function.

I started off with mapping `increment` over a list of numbers, but I want to add `isEven` to the mix now, and all of my `Int -&gt; Int` signatures need to become more flexible obviously.

At a high level, I want to have some signature like

```
transform : a -&gt; Operation (a -&gt; b) -&gt; b
```

I think my main challenge is figuring out how to model `Operation`. I feel like it should be something like:

```
type Operation
    = Increment (Int -&gt; Int)
    | Decrement (Int -&gt; Int)
    | IsEven (Int -&gt; Bool)
```

But I’d love to get some advice about modeling this in a flexible way.

Thanks!"
121,1547334727.2267,Timika,"Cool project! :slightly_smiling_face: I am wondering why for example `Increment` carries a function around with it. Isn’t there only one possible implementation for that anyway? It feels to me that the actual function should not be part of the `Operation` type.

I think the core issue is the fact that your functions can be any unary function which makes it very hard to model in a custom type. It could be that it is impossible to model this generically in Elm.

`transform` is basically `|&gt;`, which in turn is just function application. With that in mind, I am wondering if an operation type is necessary at all, they are just functions.

This is just me rambling, but maybe there is something useful in there somewhere. Also: _“Not Penny’s Boat_“ :wink:"
121,1547335164.2302,Earnest,"<@Forrest> Do you mean something like this?

  | Accumulatation b (a -&gt; b -&gt; b)

121,1547354074.2388,Forrest,"Yeah that actually makes a lot of sense!

The whole time I’ve felt weird about trying to model the core of lambda calc as a type haha. It’s great to hear another voice say that’s overkill.

The high level is to try to represent the model in a generic way. Given that I’ll have a variety of input and output types, do you see a way that doesn’t involve separate list types on the model for each output type?; Thanks for the feedback! <@Timika> picked up what I was putting down. I’m going for representing the selected list and function, whether a -&gt; Bool, a -&gt; b, or other, as generically as possible.

123,1547364015.2453,Earlean,These kind of decisions tend to be application specific. But always try to only store a value once.
121,1547373272.2522,Timika,"I thought about this and I think there is a solution from a different angle. If all your types are finite you could make a custom type that wraps all possible types in your app. ‘type SeeFpType = IntValue Int | CatValue Cat | ...’. Your functions can then be functions from SeeFpType to SeeFpType. It makes implementation of those functions more complicated as you have to check within those functions if you got the correct input type and handle mismatchs yourself. 

But it would allow you to have a List of all functions, because their types are the same. Maybe it’s a route you can go?"
122,1547374063.2524,Lynne,"Custom types suit well to store both route and data. Given examples from the section ""Examples 3"" on the page you mentioned the simplest example could be:
```
type Route
    = ElmBasics
    | ElmMaybe
    | ElmList (Maybe String)
```
If you'd want go wilder you could replace `Maybe String` with another type denoting concrete place on the page to show when it is loaded.
It allows to store route and relevant data in single place  making your `update` less error-prone, your model thinner, and `view` easier to judge on. And you also get a feature of making impossible state irrepresentable in contrast to separate entries in your model record."

```
connect : Node a -&gt; String -&gt; Node b -&gt; Connection
connect a dest b =
  ( a.id, b.id, dest )
```
This is all fine and dandy but I'd like both Node and OscillatorNode to be opaque types as I don't want anyone creating Nodes directly and I already supply a creator function for oscillators. I think I'm just being silly but how do I access the `id` field when the type is opaque?"

125,1547402225.2667,Carman,"Looking at your example, the extensible record + `type_` field is a bit of a smell pointing out that a custom type may be a better modeling of your domain.; For example something like:

type Node

It seemed redundant when all nodes share some common fields, and (I think) allowed for user-defined nodes; I think I probably agree on `type_` being less than ideal (and probably makes my whole ""user defined nodes"" thing break...); Using a type like that also means I have to `case` over all the options and perform the exact same operation when I want to have generic `Node` functions, no?"
125,1547402451.2718,Carman,"correct; A variation that extracts the common fields could look like this:

130,1547451949.2892,Lynne,This is not trivial. Basically you need a function rounding to N digits after comma (in your case 1 digit).; This is an example: `String.fromFloat &lt;| (toFloat &lt;| ceiling ((4.1 - 1) * 10.0)) / 10.0`; You may need to look for some library already defining such functions
130,1547452213.2898,Raymonde,"<@Lynne> The problem is the number input from user, so the digits after comma is arbitrary"
130,1547452702.29,Lynne,"I understand, just replace `4.1` with whatever you parse from that input then; The most crucial part here is multiplying by 10^N, ceiling and then dividing by 10^N where N is number of digits after comma; Are you saying that you don't know exactly how many digits after comma you want?"
130,1547452786.2906,Raymonde,Yeah
130,1547452790.2908,Lynne,I see; I am actually not sure it is possible to solve this without knowing number of digits; Due to the nature of floating point numbers; At some point rounding should happen

130,1547453076.2921,Lynne,I would actually check what problem you are trying to solve; For most tasks in the world 4 digits are usually enough
130,1547453102.2926,Jin,"You already have to turn the textual input into a number, probably. This would be a good place to also check for the  significant digits."

144,1547559575.3735,Lynne,Absolutely not. It was a bit early in the morning and I just copied the code from my project where it was three fields; In fact you could do conversion to `Index` in the `parseStep` function prior to returning `Done`; So you would return `Parser (Step (List Int) Index)` from `parseStep`.

146,1547567946.3762,Allyn,Hello. I was looking for a package to add same basic charts to an app. Is there a lib to create at least pie and histograms?
146,1547568371.3765,Timika,<https://code.gampleman.eu/elm-visualization/> might be what you’re looking for
146,1547568420.3772,Agustin,If you just want simple line charts then I can recommend <https://github.com/terezka/line-charts>
146,1547569021.3783,Leoma,"Design pattern question:

Suppose I have an app with several “Page”s which are essentially different views/ui’s for a shared set of data.
Part of each Page is a search field, and that value should be shared among these Pages.

1. Solution: each Page has a search field, and navigations between pages transfer the search value.
Problem: if we jump to a non-search Page, then back, we lose the search

2. Solution: search value is stored in the top-level model, and not the pages.
Problem: Page search update -&gt; dispatching an external message to parent -&gt; parent getting a search value and setting in, then calling the page’s update with the new search value.
This is very “circular” and a bit confusing. There is nothing in the type system to enforce notifying the child during parent’s update (i.e. the parent sets its search field and forgets to do the work of notifying child components if they are interested.)

3. Solution: search value is part of a type that every page must be able to store.
Therefore, a Page can maintain it’s own search value, and the Main update can transfer the value between pages.
Problem: why does my Login page have a search value?!

4. Solution: our top-level model looks like:
{ ...
  page : PageModel
...
}

type PageModel =
  | Page1Model Page1.Model Page1Leftovers
  | Page2Model Page2.Model Page2Leftovers
  ...

where we are guaranteed to have:

searchValue : PageModel -&gt; String

such that, if the PageX.Model is interested, it stores the search. If not, we store it in the “leftovers”.
Problem: ??? Is there a problem?"
146,1547569544.3794,Earlean,<@Leoma> you could store the search value in the page and the top-level model and pass it in to pages and take it out of pages on navigation.; that's essentially option 2 but only on navigation
146,1547569746.3803,Allyn,"thank you, that's perfect!"
146,1547570141.3835,Leoma,"The thing I like about 4, is that when our top-level update gets a `SearchUpdated search` it has do to something with it. And if our top-level model has a `search : String` it’s easy to set it and think the work is over. Whereas if our top level model doesn’t have an explicit search field, we’re reminded by the type system that we have to figure out where it goes: the interested page, or in the leftover storage. However, this (seems at the moment) more complicated than it should be."
146,1547571060.3878,Ashton,"Among the ones you listed, I would fight for 1. The problem is only that somes pages contain data they dont use. Seems perfectly fine to me. Theres nothing wrong with persisting data you dont use but expect to use later. Mostly importantly tho, its the simplest. Aside from imports and extracting/injecting this value, I think the impact on your case base could be merely one line:
```
, search : SearchModel
```
I dont see the other solutions as coming close in terms of simplicity."
146,1547571144.3886,Leoma,"Right, so I think that’s 3… ?; I do agree, that this is simplest. Maybe simplicity wins over “correctness” here."
146,1547571176.3893,Ashton,"Regarding 4, what if you have three pages? Do you need `LeftOvers` types for every page it could have come from?"
146,1547571308.3894,Leoma,"So I think I’d create a toplevel function
`searchValue : PageModel -&gt; String`.

And also, have each Page only store what it needs.

Then, the toplevel module is forced to figure out how to store the extra data to be able to satisfy the implementation of `searchValue`.

I like this mainly because I’m using the type system to enforce “things store only what they need, and but we must still store all the things”"

Like all of you (probably), I too believe that Elm is a ""Delightful"" language, so I would really like to contribute some work. I was wondering, whether basic data structures like Set, Stack, Queue are already implemented in Elm... If not, is there a reason why? Maybe any other idea how i could contribute?; Thanks in advance for your answers :wink:"

150,1547593926.4123,Virgie,"`Set` is in core, and `Stack` is as well (our `List` is a linked-list, which behaves exactly like a stack)."
150,1547593943.4129,Lucia,"Thanks.. Yep, i did a little more research and found out the same. :slightly_smiling_face: I guess I'll have to find something else :smile:"
150,1547593974.4134,Virgie,"I think there are some queues. Note that elm is a functional language, and its purity make implementing datastructures less straightforward"
150,1547594146.4144,Ruthann,a LIFO is trivial with a linked list; a FILO is trivial if it allows 2n space to store the reverse as well
150,1547594223.4154,Virgie,"getting the performance/space consumption that imperative languages achieve can be a challenge; on the other hand, in a future where elm runs on a platform with multiple threads, our data structures are thread safe by default; As to where you can contribute: is there anything you are particularly interested in actually doing?"
150,1547594462.4192,Lucia,"I'm not really sure :smile: I'm a student, i had a subject, where we were programming in Elm and it was really interesting. I would really like to continue upgrading my knowledge in functional programming."
150,1547594553.4203,Virgie,"well picking a subject you like can really help.

150,1547594790.4235,Virgie,"there is one of those quotes at the slack startup saying roughly ""not all contributions are code"", in fact most contributions are/should not be in code; and a newcomer's perspective is very valuable"

151,1547597694.4323,Fay,"hello, looking forward to get in touch with Elm closely, but faced one issue.
My plan is not to write views in the beginning but instead simply output model as-is using Microsoft/elm-json-tree-view
But the issue here that I can't output model (record) as a JSON to Decode it afterwards
Json.Encode also requires List (String, a) for encoding to JSON
 Anyone know how to Encode a record or I'm missing something obvious?"
151,1547597814.4326,Virgie,records are encoded as a collection of fields; for instance the example here <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/> encodes the `Cause` record
151,1547598040.4357,Fay,"<@Virgie> great
but what if I don't know the structure?
would be a little overkill to describe the whole model for encoding
for instance elm-json-tree-view produces Html msg on any form
my idea to use the same for model
Model -&gt; ... -&gt; Html msg"
151,1547598229.4362,Virgie,"I think the only generic way is to use `Debug.toString` on the model, then `Html.text` on that string; normally you'd be able to use the debugger to inspect the model without actually drawing anything, but the debugger is not reliable in 0.19 so far"
151,1547598348.4389,Fay,"<@Virgie> that was the case for me, the only issue is that it prints model different
```{ content = { text = ""Example"" } }```
instead of JSON form
```{ ""content"": { ""text"": ""Example"" } }```; to I guess I need to make some regex work"
151,1547598395.4398,Virgie,why do you want to display json strings?
151,1547598445.4409,Fay,"I don't
I need Model to be usable to generate view by elm-json-tree-view"
151,1547598452.4413,Virgie,"because in essence there is no ""free"" way to turn an elm object into json. You have to write an encoder"
151,1547598475.4416,Fay,"I understand; even so
i guess encoder will require explicit field names etc."
151,1547598569.4429,Virgie,yes
151,1547598611.4438,Fay,which is not my case
151,1547598625.4444,Virgie,"so while a tree-like view would be very nice, and will be possible once the debugger works reliably, for now I prefer Debug.log and Debug.toString"
151,1547598637.4446,Fay,"yep; the reason I was asking here
it sounds so weird not to have iterator for record fields that it made me stuck ); one more question

163,1547670638.5054,Virgie,<@Jae> <https://github.com/elm-explorations/test/issues/54>; tldr make elm/json a direct dependency
163,1547670730.5059,Jae,"Yup, that works. Thanks!"
164,1547674726.5071,Yolande,"I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use elm/parser. This example helps (<https://github.com/elm/parser/blob/1.1.0/examples/DoubleQuoteString.elm>) but what is the `run` keyword?; ah, `Parser.run`"
164,1547674767.5077,Virgie,exactly
164,1547674776.5079,Danika,<https://github.com/elm/parser/blob/1.1.0/src/Parser.elm#L95>; ^^; this is why exposing everything in an import is discouraged btw; that example would be much clearer if `import Parser exposing (run)` or `Parser.run` were used
165,1547676544.5096,Yolande,"Can I make a type alias for `(Int, Int)`?"
165,1547676571.5098,Carman,"Sure; `type alias TwoIntegers = (Int, Int)`; aliases are alternate names for existing types; you can alias any type you want; if it can be seen in a type signature, it can be aliased"
165,1547676662.5122,Yolande,Gotcha. Thought so. I think I'm also confused about how `succeed` works in elm/parser
165,1547676663.5123,Carman,even function types can be aliased: `type Predicate a = a -&gt; Bool`
165,1547676700.5135,Yolande,"`succeed TwoIntegers` gives ""I cannot find a `TwoIntegers` constructor"""
165,1547676700.5136,Carman,Note that you don't need a type alias to use parsers
165,1547676713.5142,Yolande,"Didn't think so either, but good to know"
165,1547676725.5144,Carman,`succeed` wants a function; when you alias records Elm will automatically create a constructor function of the same name
165,1547676760.5155,Yolande,ah but not tuples
165,1547676785.5159,Carman,"To parse into a tuple you could use a lambda `succeed (\x y -&gt; (x, y))`; or alternatively the tuple constructor from the core library `succeed Tuple.pair`"
165,1547676879.5168,Yolande,"nice, thanks!"
166,1547684674.5169,Freida,Has anyone run into this error
166,1547684736.5172,Earnest,Is `Json` a module in your package? Did you mean `Json.Encode` or `Json.Decode`?
166,1547684762.5174,Freida,I'm trying to import elm/json
166,1547684792.5176,Earnest,"There's no `Json` module in that project, just the two I mentioned above; `import Json` doesn't import both of them, if that's what you were trying to do; I usually do something like
```
import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (Decoder)
import Json.Encode as Encode exposing (Value)
```"
166,1547684907.5182,Freida,"So I'm assuming this does not work ``` Browser.Events.onClick (Json.map message (<http://Json.at|Json.at> [""offsetLeft""] <http://Json.int|Json.int>))```"
166,1547684930.5184,Earnest,not unless you do `import Json.Decode as Json`; then any use of Json in your code will refer to the Json.Decode module
167,1547698770.5198,Marcus,"With Elm 0.19, does anyone know where the Http.uriEncode method went? I'm building a querystring and need to make sure the params I add to it will cooperate.; Looks like it's in the Url package now."
168,1547706414.5202,Maryrose,The `Url.Builder` is the new way to build your urls. Or if that proves hard when migrating `percentEncode` is also available
169,1547707537.5207,Zachary,What is the best way to build elm package (not an application) on a CI?
169,1547707827.5209,Earnest,I just call elm-make: <https://github.com/prikhi/paginate/blob/master/.travis.yml#L26>
169,1547708024.5213,Zachary,Maybe I should use jq to extract all exposed modules; Ah it requires all modules live in `src`; :man-facepalming:; there's no way to configure source-directories for packages?
170,1547712356.5247,Yolande,"I'm confused about elm/color. Here's a repo: <https://github.com/elm/color>. Here it looks like it's part of the standard library: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Color>. `import Color` says ""I cannot find that module!"". `elm install elm/color` says PACKAGE NOT FOUND. How do I use elm/color in my project?"
170,1547712997.5262,Earlean,"<@Yolande> it was in core in Elm 0.18, it's was moved out of core, but never released; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/avh4/elm-color/latest/> is a fork of that package"

169,1547714540.5272,Iona,<@Zachary> I’ll get working on changing that
169,1547715231.5294,Dorsey,There uesd to be an archive of Elm Slack IIRC at <https://elmlang.slackarchive.io/> but now it redirects to the source repo on GitHub. Is there anything like that around? I need to find a link to the Ellie example I was discussing here few months ago :neutral_face:
169,1547715396.5296,Zachary,thanks!
171,1547717124.5299,Yolande,"cool, thanks <@Earlean>"
172,1547718273.5304,Yang,what does it mean that elm has drag and drop support in the standard library? im watching this video: <https://youtu.be/RFrKffrKCeU?t=281>
172,1547718537.5319,Lynne,"I think she means possibility to add arbitrary event handlers (with help of `Html.Events.on` and other functions from that module), possibly comparing with earlier versions of Elm where there was no such possibility (I am guessing); Or may be she refers to <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/norpan/elm-html5-drag-drop/> for some reason calling it ""standard library""; The main thing here is that implementing drag and drop in Elm is possible nowadays without single line of JS code"
173,1547719486.5339,Rosalind,"<@Dorsey> - nope, once the message disappears behind the 10,000 limit you won't be able to see it"
174,1547731050.5354,Leonore,"Hey all, what would you name a ternary conditional function in Elm? So something that takes a condition and returns the second argument if true, and the third if not.; The ""?"" operator in C# basically"
174,1547731134.5368,Virgie,"because `if` is an expression (and not a statement, like in most c-like languages) we can just use it as the ternary operator"
174,1547731137.537,Danika,if then else operates how the ternary does in other languages 
174,1547731180.5377,Virgie,and writing the `if` out is common and (in my opinion) clearer than hiding it behind a function
174,1547731204.5381,Leonore,But I want it on the same line :sweat_smile:
174,1547731227.5385,Danika,Then dont use elm format :sweat_smile:

I have this code that I use as a generic `onPaste` event, it's meant to prevent the content being pasted into the target element but the JS equivalent of `e.preventDefault` doesn't occur..

```

176,1547800423.5473,Yang,"<@Lesli> this can mean the preventDefaultOn function is broken. Test if it works in pure js. If it does, then maybe use the `custom` function. This might not work also because with the HTML module, the event is placed on a specific DOM element - is not global. But if it works in js it should be a simple straight forward translation."
177,1547804385.5485,Renda,"Can I somehow ""watch"" elm debugger from JavaScript? Like, getting events when stepping through the debugger? I do not want to send anything to Elm, but I would like to get the model in JS while using the debugger."
177,1547804722.5518,Nana,"<@Renda> you could do this:
```
main =
    Browser.element
        { init = init
        , update = Debug.log ""update"" update
        , subscriptions = \_ -&gt; Sub.none

        }

177,1547804768.5522,Danika,Oh hey thats pretty clever actually 
177,1547804957.5551,Elyse,"Are you not logging the update function like this?
I figured it would have been something like this:
```
main =
    Browser.element

        }
```
(but nice trick :+1:)"
177,1547804974.5554,Nana,"btw, another trick that I heard from <@Carman> is that you can wrap your update function so that it sends the model or part of the model to JS through a port on every update, enabling ""observable"" style stuff"
177,1547805061.5572,Renda,"Oh very cool stuff <@Nana> thank you. I did not think about Debug like it would be calling the update function, thought it was just some ""magic"" going on behind the scenes, this is great and makes sense even to a newbie like me :smile:; That port idea sounds good too. Since I am using a port to update my JS I could just re-use my code as it is now!; Maybe you could show an example on how <@Carman> ?"
177,1547805306.5603,Nana,"<@Elyse> ah right, yes it should be `update = \msg model -&gt; Debug.log ""update"" &lt;| update msg model`; although it just makes a huge mess in the console when your model is big :stuck_out_tongue: probably better to just log specific stuff in that case; <@Renda> here's an example of ""watching"" the model and sending to js :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://ellie-app.com/4tRKwNW9F2Ja1>; maybe it should be moved out into it's own function instead of `let..in` though; this ""watch"" approach would be perfect if you're using a pub/sub client in JS I think"
178,1547810491.5687,Charmaine,can there by some kind of performance hit if a custom type has hundreds of constructors?
177,1547811521.57,Nana,"<@Charmaine> seems unlikely to me, I assume that's just like defining hundreds of top-level functions? they're not like a part of the type which gets instantiated"
178,1547811628.5713,Charmaine,that makes sense - i'm autogenerating keys for i18n texts and wanted to check beforehand if it might have troubles
177,1547811686.5719,Nana,"though if you were to case on them it could be an issue perhaps?; like ""is this value one of these hundred things"""
177,1547811824.5728,Charmaine,yeah it's gonna do the case when selecting the id so that's what i was worried about; it seems that elm case compiles to js switch statement so i guess i'll have to check potential performance issue there
177,1547812355.5746,Huong,"In our current (0.18 still) env, we use a huge union type for i18n texts. There's a huge compile-time hit, but performance at runtime is not an issue at all.; (by huge, I mean ~1k constructors)"
177,1547812451.5755,Nana,<@Huong> why a union type rather than a record?
177,1547812460.5758,Huong,"Compile time in 0.19 shouldn't be an issue, though; Not sure, we've been doing it this way since Elm 0.15 or .16, and we haven't really had the courage to try and change it"
177,1547813076.5784,Timika,<@Huong> That’s super interesting! Do you have some more details written down somewhere?
179,1547813155.5805,Renda,<@Kaylee> hey thanks for the Ellie example. However I think I did not explain myself correctly. What I wish to do is when I go through the debug timetravel I want the clicked state to be send through the port. So that I can update my JS to the time travelled state. Does that make sense?
177,1547813186.5817,Danika,does timetravel not trigger `update`
177,1547813202.5821,Huong,"<@Timika> about the entire thing or just the translation system? (to be fair, I'm not super happy with it, and reworking that bit is on my every-expanding-todo-list :wink: )"
177,1547813233.5827,Timika,"I’m most interested in the t10n stuff as this is something we might have to do soon as well. :slightly_smiling_face:; Regardless of how awesome the solution is, having first-hand experience reports always helps when evaluating a possible solution."
177,1547813330.5847,Renda,"<@Danika> it does not seem to trigger sending messages through a port. Take a look, this is the example Simon made for me, and I do not get console logs while going through the debugger:

180,1547815996.589,Renda,Well thats unfortunate because I do have a usecase. What are my options then? Is it possible to expose the model read only to JS ? So I can see it change?
180,1547816513.5892,Earlean,There isn't. ; The thing you want to do isn't something the debugger was designed to support
180,1547817349.5896,Renda,Hm ok. I guess I just have to keep track of the model in both JS and Elm then.

But for some weird reason VIEW message comes before the UPDATE message and, naturally, I see that outdated model is rendered.; Why in the heaven `view` is not triggered after `update` has changed the model?"

type alias B =

You'd be able to input in a textarea:

```
createA [
  createB 102 ""hello"",
  createB 0 ""world"",

Which should parse into valid data and sent on its merry way however I decide in Elm. This, i believe, is somewhat trivial to do with the parser, but consider I now have a function:

setFoo : Int -&gt; B -&gt; B
setFoo newFoo b =
  { b | foo = newFoo }

You can assume that the way `createB` and the `setX` functions are valid real Elm code you could write in my app."
188,1547903616.6259,Virgie,"because elm is a statically typed language such a DSL would not be very flexible. For instance to call elm functions, you'd need a way of mapping the function name to the actual function; and that is hard because you can't store it in a uniform way, like a `Dict String Function` because the function type is different between like `+` or `++`; (you'd need some casting mechanism for this, or quantification, anyway more advanced type-level features than elm has); so mixing elm code with interpreted code in a flexible way is hard/not feasible"
188,1547903767.6267,Danika,"Hmm, that is discouraging but makes sense."
189,1547907477.6281,Lynne,"So it must be connected to how Elm is batching model updates to only call `view` once per animation frame. Adding JS

```
        this.addEventListener('focus', () =&gt; {
            setTimeout(() =&gt; this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('delayed-focus')), 5);
        });
```
and subscribing to `delayed-focus` in Elm fixes the issue; Is anyone aware of any Github issue this could be added to?"

190,1547911251.6322,Earlean,<@Jae> it's a known bug in the compiler. If you're using the `--debug` flag with the compiler then not using that may solve the problem.; If you're not using the `--debug` flag and still seeing that error then you've encountered a version of the bug for which there isn't currently a work around.
190,1547911423.6349,Jae,"Alright thanks, I'll try that; Yup that works. I guess it's a little ironic that installing a package designed to help with debugging has led me to disable the debugger"

191,1547918487.6381,Virgie,it has been very quiet on that front. Even if it were fixed today there are maybe some other things that it would also make sense to include in a 0.19.1 (adding/upgrading packages for instance) release so I'd guess it's not coming very soon
192,1547920778.6387,Loyce,Hi everyone - are there recommendations on best Elm book that covers SPAs in detail from the ground up in 0.19?
193,1547923161.639,Jana,Yes!
192,1547926040.6395,Allyn,I would say “Practical Elm for a Busy Developer” <https://korban.net/elm/book/>
193,1547947833.6415,Marlin,"how can I generate a random value for use in a Task? I see that <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/Random> has a `generate` function that returns a `Cmd`, but I’m looking for a `Task`; I also found <https://gist.github.com/JoelQ/c93a8f6a81262ff12c93ab2ff859f8e5> but as far as I can tell that produces the same value every time, it is not actually random at all"
193,1547950178.6418,Earlean,"<@Marlin> there isn't a way to do it as a Task and have the runtime manage the seed, but you can `step` and generator in a Task if you manage the seed yourself"
193,1547950687.642,Marlin,"okay, thanks"
193,1547952134.6424,Carman,<@Marlin> The gist you found (written for 0.18) uses the current time as the seed. It should give you different results every time unless you've frozen you clock somehow
194,1547952515.6426,Carman,"Here's a working example for 0.19: <https://ellie-app.com/4vCp7Vzz5cNa1>; Note that I'm executing it via `Task.perform`, _not_ `Random.generate`"
193,1547952827.6431,Marlin,"ah, sorry I missed the time, I must have ~called it twice in one second~ been unlucky (and obviously I didn’t read it very carefully!); thanks for the updated example, this is helpful; for now, I’m probably going to have to leave out randomness and keep a `TODO` comment, since it doesn’t really make sense for consumers of the module I’m writing to have to worry about helping manage the seed state"
195,1547961901.6443,Danika,What does the module do
196,1548018610.6503,Florencia,"I'm musing about what pattern is this... is it an `andThen`?
```
andThen : (model -&gt; (model, cmd)) -&gt; (model, cmd) -&gt; (model, cmd)

    let
        (newModel, anotherCmd) =
            modelToModelCmdTuple model
    in
        ( newModel
        , Cmd.batch [cmd, anotherCmd]
        )
```
ie.
```
model
    |&gt; doStuffWithCmds
    -- we have `(model, cmd)` now
    -- but `doDifferentStuffWithCmds` needs a `model`
    -- so we use this combinator or whatever it is
    |&gt; andThen doDifferentStuffWithCmds
```; <@Leoma> <@Ashton> Maybe you folks have some insight into it, given our previous cmd-related discussions? :slightly_smiling_face:; monadic `andThen` is `(a -&gt; Monad b) -&gt; Monad a -&gt; Monad c`
ie. `Json.Decode.andThen : (a -&gt; Decoder b) -&gt; Decoder a -&gt; Decoder b`
so ... the type signature probably checks out, right?"
196,1548018826.6534,Carrol,You seem to have extra parans in the signature
196,1548018848.6543,Florencia,the right-associativity makes it a non-problem though I think; it's interesting there's no `Cmd.andThen` in any of our packages! :slightly_smiling_face:
196,1548018853.6546,Carrol,`andThen` sounds right to me.
196,1548018868.655,Florencia,but yeah I should fix the parens
196,1548018898.6556,Carrol,"We have the same:

197,1548020396.6582,Ashton,Yeah looks like `andThen` to me.; Theres probably some fancy FP word for an `andThen` that binds back onto the same type.
197,1548021119.6613,Agustin,`map`?
197,1548021204.6625,Ashton,"No. I mean. The model/cmd tuple goes `(m -&gt; M m) -&gt; M m -&gt; M m`. Lower case `m` all the way through. Unlike the normal case of going `a -&gt; M b`, where it goes from type `a` to type `b`"
197,1548021235.6632,Florencia,oh I see what you mean; something-something-morphism :sweat_smile:
197,1548021280.6648,Ashton,"Actually, I started a conversation a few months back in here asking if `(a -&gt; a) -&gt; M a -&gt; M a` is still “mapping”. And there were disagreeing voices, but I think team “yes” won.; Yeah exactly. Haha. A something-morphism.; Endo-thing."
197,1548021435.6665,Florencia,"Is this what ordinary programmers trying to look like category theorists look like? :joy:; (honestly, I love this discussion)"
197,1548021666.6677,Carman,"Hmmm I think the term might be ""monomorphic"" (one shape)?; Although I've usually seen the term used for functions that had a concrete type like `String.map : (Char -&gt; Char) -&gt; String -&gt; String`"
197,1548021879.6688,Agustin,There is this theory… of the möbius… where the types become a loop.

203,1548060116.6971,Nana,"so I came up with a solution to my ""problem"" earlier regarding setting `RemoteData` to `Loading` not actually being tied to loading the data.

instead of having the usual:
`getFolder : FileContainer.ID -&gt; Cmd Msg`
you can have:
`loadFolder : FileContainer.ID -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg ) -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )`
and then instead of doing:
`({model | folder = Loading}, getFolder folderId)`
you do:
`(model, Cmd.none) |&gt; loadFolder folderId`; is this a common pattern?"
203,1548060418.6992,Karissa,"I think so yes. I found it's really nice to have complex update functions implemented as a pipe of functions. You can even create a function `andThen` that abstracts the Cmd.batch mecanism.; Something like:
```
andThen : (Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd msg)) -&gt; (Model, Cmd msg) -&gt; (Model, Cmd msg)
andThen function (model, cmds) =
    let
        (newModel, extraCmds) =
            function model

That you can use like this: `(model, Cmd.none) |&gt; andThen (loadFolder folderId) |&gt; andThen otherFunction`."

203,1548071550.7051,Ashton,"Cant the domain and co-domain be the same domain? Or, cant the domain and co-domain have the same type?; I guess its just a matter of how you define it, but, a function can go `a -&gt; a`. Thats not an issue.

203,1548072237.7071,Alysa,no guarantees for result ordering... but i think at least they would be issued in that order?
205,1548072619.7073,Bert,"IIRC they are issued in the reverse order. As in, FILO for a recursive tree structure"
203,1548072687.7075,Karissa,Yeah the name is chosen to be consistent with Maybe.andThen etc.

206,1548075611.7082,Niesha,`map2` etc. sound appropriate here
206,1548076616.7096,Karissa,Without changing the signature it wouldn't be consistent. And I still like to convey the idea of chaining or piping changes to Model while retaining the ability to produce Cmds. Maybe `chain` or something like that.

207,1548076762.7106,Niesha,It's basically about Applicative &lt;=&gt; Monad congruence. <https://github.com/facebook/Haxl/issues/58> - you're defining an `andThen` which doesn't follow the rules.
207,1548077174.711,Jae,Is there a work around?; I checked the github issue for it and it doesn't look like there is.
208,1548078802.7113,Zona,it can but than it’s not general enough right?; that was the meaning of comment. that even map has independent domain and co-domain. Anyway there is a lot of things in stdlib which do `a -&gt; a` - those functions are called `update`.

209,1548083074.7143,Shenita,`Debug.Log` is the only API for logging currently; but you can make your own fairly straightforwardly using ports; e.g. `port log : String -&gt; Cmd msg` and then in JS `app.ports.log.subscribe(msg =&gt; console.log(msg))`

I think they're asking if there is something similar in elm. There is not, afaik modules cant ""export"" things they import.; If you're finding that you want this sort of functionality in elm, it might be because you've prematurely split your code into modules when you don't need to. Elm files are naturally very tall; having seperate files for `Function.Increment` and `Function.StartsWithH` would be a code smell imo"
213,1548102650.7261,Leoma,"You can use ports to send basic types or anything you can convert to a JSON Value to the JS side and log there.; The, possibly confusing thing, is that if you batch a bunch of Cmd Msg together, you have no guarantees about execution order.

222,1548169373.765,Sadie,Hello dear friends; Once more I am seeking your precious advices; I am building a SPA with Richard Feldman Elm Architecture (and the benefits of elm-kitchen); I have a url router; In my session I have a bearer token; I don't know exactly when to fetch the user profile related to this bearer token; Shall I do it in all pages init command in case it is missing ?
222,1548169620.7699,Lynne,"That's an option. An alternative might be to fetch it in your root `Main.elm` and store on that level, passing to `init` functions of each page"
222,1548169745.7721,Sadie,"Yes that kind what I wanted to do; But then I need to add a step before using setRoute, right?"
223,1548170190.7776,Allyn,"Hello. I started using <@Freda>’s I18Next, and followed the given example (<https://github.com/ChristophP/elm-i18next/tree/4.0.0>) to pass the translations to the app using flags. It works well. Now I want to pass more than the translations to the app, so the translations would become a property of the flags (something like { translations : { english : ... }, user : { ... } }). It implies I write a Decoder, which will invoke I18Next’s provided one (translationsDecoder). My problem is I can’t say my decoder produces I18Next.Translations, because the Translations type is opaque (constructors are not exposed). So I can’t write something like :
```Decode.succeed Translations 
          |&gt; requiredAt [""translations""] translationsDecoder ...```"
222,1548170315.7787,Carman,Do you want to just decode the translations? or both the translations and the user?
222,1548170322.7789,Allyn,both
222,1548170361.7803,Carman,"Then you want a function that can take a translation and a user and return some other structure such as a tuple; ```
Decode.succeed (\translations user -&gt; (translations, user))
  |&gt; required ""translations"" traslationDecoder
  |&gt; required ""user"" userDecoder
```"
222,1548170409.7824,Freda,Glad your using the package. You'd have to do `Decode.succeed Model` instead of `Decode succeed Translations`
222,1548170509.784,Carman,The important thing to understand with pipeline decoders is that the argument to `succeed` is a function that will build some structure out _n_ arguments from each of the piped lines below it
222,1548170573.785,Allyn,"I think I get it, i’ll try that now. Thank you <@Carman> and <@Freda>; :slightly_smiling_face:"
224,1548171727.7853,Lynne,"Yes, you are right; A positive thing here is that you don't have to deal with `Maybe Profile` in your other pages"
225,1548181016.7915,Bernardo,"So, I’ve been following the ‘life of a file’ approach (aka <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/5jd2xn/how_to_structure_elm_with_multiple_models/dbuu0m4/>), and I’ve ended up in a slightly awkward situation:
I split my model up with a union type (i.e. `model = FooModel FooRecord | BarModel BarRecord`),
then  later I split up my `Msg` type too (i.e. `type Msg = FooMsg Foos | BarMsg Bars`).

That all seemed well and fine (using `Cmd.map` and `Html.map`), but:
I’m increasingly running in to situations where I have to add an `otherwise -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)` to handle cases where the `Msg` no longer makes sense with the `Model`. Is there a way around this, is it a smell?"
225,1548181449.7935,Nana,"Yeah I'm curious about this too. Although I'm guessing there might not be a perfect solution.
elm-spa-example uses cases like:
```
_ -&gt;
    ( model, Log.error )
```
(Log.error sends a message to a error tracking service)"
225,1548181642.7949,Bernardo,"<@Nana> funny you should reference elm-spa-example, I just found elm-kitchen, which says:
&gt; This is a modest attempt at providing a simplistic yet opinionated Elm SPA application skeleton based on rtfeldman’s Elm Example SPA,
And has a similar smoking gun, here: <https://github.com/allo-media/elm-kitchen/blob/master/skeleton/src/Main.elm#L129>"
225,1548181718.796,Carman,"This is a hard problem. You want some messages to only come in when your're in certain states.; The fact that messages are asynchronous makes it even trickier; Consider firing off a slow HTTP request when your model is in the `FooModel ...` state. While the request is happening in the background, the user clicks a button and transitions the app into the `BarModel ...` state. _After_ that has happened, the HTTP request completes, giving you a `FooMsg ...`. How do you handle the situation?"
225,1548181956.8036,Bernardo,"Heh, I think your use of ‘a hard problem’ is very fitting, if you squint at “state” and “transitions” it does start to look a lot like “cache invalidation”, and of course: <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html>"
225,1548181998.8049,Bert,"Here's another example for food of thought. Imagine that you have a messaging app. No matter which conversation the user is viewing, the app can get different Msgs, including new incoming texts from other conversations. You probably do want the texts to be added to the convos, even if you are viewing another one at the moment. "
225,1548182040.8056,Bernardo,"Okay, it sounds like I’m not going crazy, and this is a ‘thing’. Has the Elm community come up with a name for it I wonder? :thinking_face:"
225,1548182095.8065,Carman,"I've heard ""make invalid state transitions impossible"" or variations on that; As far as I can tell, there is no way to do this at the type level"
225,1548182164.8085,Bernardo,"Yeah. It’s exactly the word ‘impossible’ which made me think I was doing something wrong. I’d gotten all giddy after watching <@Leonie>’s “making impossible states impossible” talk, and then was confronted with this ‘situation’ :grimacing:"
225,1548182175.8088,Carman,<https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/can-phantom-types-be-used-to-restrict-the-possible-transitions-in-a-state-machine/508>
225,1548182270.811,Nana,"<@Bert> yeah seems like the best is usually to have your ""data stores"" on your main model, rather than on a ""page model""
which mirrors how you do things in React/Redux/Vue"
226,1548182435.8113,Danika,"How is redux different, sorry?"
225,1548182577.8128,Nana,"<@Danika> I meant, storing server data on a ""page model"" in Elm is like storing things on a component in React, whereas storing it on the main model is like storing it in Redux"
225,1548182766.8138,Carman,Beware of creating invalid states and lots of maybes if you put all your data on the top-level model
225,1548183000.8156,Nana,<@Carman> hmm how would that create invalid states / lots of maybes? :thinking_face:
225,1548183496.8219,Carman,"Imagine a multi-step form that asks for address info on page 1, payment info on page 2, and a coupon code on page 3. If you put it all on the top level you end up with something like:

```
type alias Model =
  { state : State, page : Page }

type Page
  = AddressPage
  | PaymentPage
  | CouponPage
  | SuccessPage

type alias State =
  { street : Maybe String
  , city : Maybe String
  , country : Maybe String
  , cardNumber : Maybe Int
  , couponCode : Maybe String
  }
```; This allows lots of invalid states (you shouldn't be able to go to payment if you don't have an address) and has lots of maybes.

Contrast with something like:
```
type alias Model =
  { page : Page, ... }

type alias Address = { street :  String, city :  String, country :  String }

type Page
  = AddressPage { street : Maybe String, city : Maybe String, country : Maybe String }
  | PaymentPage { address : Address, cardNumber : Maybe Int }
  | CouponPage  { address : Address, cardNumber : Int, couponCode : Maybe String }
  | SuccessPage  { address : Address }
```"
225,1548183774.8238,Nana,"<@Carman> ah, I was talking about server data, form data definitely makes more sense to store on the ""page"""
225,1548183859.8245,Carman,"I think the same idea goes for server data. If there are some states where it shouldn't exist then it probably shouldn't be on the top-level model; ```
type alias Model = { profile : Maybe ProfileFromServer, page : Page }

type Page = SignUp | ProfilePage | ...
```

versus

```
type Page
  = SignUp
  | ProfilePage ProfileFromServer
  | ...
```"
225,1548184171.8275,Bernardo,"Aye, I guess the choice is between:
1. Use tagged unions (`|`) in your model, or:
2. Don’t."
227,1548184206.829,Rosalee,`type Choice = TaggedUnion | Dont`
225,1548184207.8292,Nana,"hmm, but typically you first navigate to a profile page and *then* load the data"
225,1548184259.8309,Bernardo,"1. Necessitates that you might end up with a message which only makes sense on a ‘different’ side of the union (aka the problem I first came here asking about).
2. Eliminates 1., but introduces ‘invalid states’."
225,1548184313.8319,Carman,"2 does not eliminate 1, it just obscures it"
225,1548184327.8322,Bernardo,"Uh, whoops, I put the numbers the wrong way around :joy:"
225,1548184347.8327,Nana,and how would `ProfilePage ProfileFromServer` work with navigating through urls?
225,1548184419.8335,Carman,The problem <@Bernardo> was asking about earlier (handling messages that are unexpected given the current state of the model) exists no matter how you structure the app
225,1548184490.8346,Bernardo,<@Carman> yeah. I think it’s interesting how it manifests itself in different ways.
225,1548184506.835,Carman,agreed :slightly_smiling_face:
225,1548184620.8373,Bernardo,"So yeah, it’s:
1. Use tagged unions (`|`), and know you’re forced to end up (probably) with something like `otherwise -&gt; ( model, Cmd.none )`, or:
2. Don’t use tagged unions, so you can always ‘find’ the value for which a message concerns, but accept that your model will inevitably allow inconsistent states to exist."
225,1548184659.8381,Nana,I think definitely use tagged unions for pages and such though
225,1548184712.839,Bernardo,"Thanks for the chat everyone, that was really productive! I have to lunch now though."
225,1548185095.842,Carman,"In my experience, you generally end up having to do `otherwise -&gt; ( model, Cmd.none )` regardless of which approach you take; With tagged unions (`|`) it's usually at the end of a flat case statement on all the tags. Without them it's usually a compound case on a variety of maybes and booleans."
225,1548185382.8446,Nana,"btw, the way I'm dealing with my server data, I don't consider it ""wrong"" to have data which is not relevant to the current page
for example, if you're viewing the profile of User A, having data stored for User B just means that if you then go back to User B's page, you don't have to fetch the data again; and it's always stored by ID, so User A's data would never overwrite User B's data"
225,1548185531.8462,Carman,that sort of data makes sense to store on the top-level because you always want it around regardless of what page you're on
225,1548185580.8465,Danika,app data != page data ^^

229,1548197544.8521,Bernardo,"Oh, that’s good to know! So that would bind `x` to whatever is in `x` in the record?; It does, and `Maybe.Extra` does have it :tada:; ```
Customers { modal } -&gt; isJust modal

229,1548197717.8531,Virgie,"it's a little more limited than haskell can do, but this probably makes the totallity checker much easier. Also cramming more stuff into patterns might be bad style anyway"

238,1548333593.8893,Nana,<@Desire> ah right thanks :smile: elm-css is what I've been using so far and it's been a little bit annoying actually with some of the limitations it has
239,1548334658.8895,Desire,"interesting; and yes, elm-ui is exciting"
239,1548340734.8899,Renda,"Having spent most of my day on tweaking css with display: inline-block, flexbox and the occasional negative margin, I agree!"
238,1548342280.8903,Nana,"yeah even when you know all the tricks, CSS is still fiddly. <@Leoma>"
240,1548342689.8913,Sadie,"I am using `elm-json-decode-pipeline` and I am trying to use optional but with a default value; If I use `optional ""planning"" (Decode.map Just decodePlanning) (Just Dict.empty)`; It tells me ```The argument is: Decoder (Maybe Planning -&gt; b)```; Ok can I make it a maybe.with default ?; I guess I should just remove all the Just and I should be fine; `optional ""planning"" decodePlanning Dict.empty`"
240,1548343047.8938,Glenda,"would recommend elm-ui, it's awesome! writing CSS often comes down to how well you know all the tricks and loopholes... which is not how things should be :exploding_head:"

240,1548343492.8943,Leoma,"Even though elm-ui certainly has some gaps in features and a few bugs, I’m still 100% sold on it.
Knowledge of CSS can help work around some of elm-ui’s current (and reasonably minor) issues/limitations."
238,1548343505.8945,Zachary,Removing loaders is the best part when switching to parcel :smile:
238,1548343887.8947,Nana,"<@Zachary> I think Elm-UI is way more interesting though, as it's more a language to replace CSS rather than just a set of predefined CSS classes"
240,1548344178.8966,Tracey,I guess you must return a Maybe Dict with Dict.empty.
238,1548344215.8976,Tracey,"The way you're doing you are returning only the Just part, without the Nothing.; Folks, another question.
I found myself in a situation that I think the compiler can help me to avoid.
In a mistake I have a function A that returns function B then returns function A again.
As a human I know that this will lead me to a infinite loop. But  I'm wondering if there is a way we can make the compiler identify that misleading before it happen in runtime."
240,1548345701.904,Niesha,<@Tracey> totality detection isn't possible with a Turing-complete language :disappointed:

238,1548346371.906,Simon,"You can detect some programs that won’t halt, you just can’t guarantee you’ll detect all of them."
240,1548346408.9067,Simon,So the compiler could tell you if you’ve created something known to be infinitely recursive; some languages do do this already
240,1548347016.9078,Huong,"Elm does this for values (e.g. decoders, where people run into this fairly regularly); it doesn't do this for functions, and that's actually something used in the implementations of functions like `never : Never -&gt; a`; (which is pretty much `never (Never v) = never v` given `type Never = Never Never`)"
240,1548347315.9102,Karrie,"hello everyone! I’m having a weird error that I never encountered before:
```The `Http` module does not expose a `Request` type. These names seem close```; this is my code:
```

240,1548347537.9114,Earnest,There is no `Request` type in the Http module anymore: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/Http>
240,1548347569.9115,Zona,functor is defined for as `for all a b.` of course you can use it in case where `a = b` but you can't say that thing that supports only this case is functor. if so then everything would be functor because this is true for any data type. It can be defined as `map _ a = a`; therefore it doesn't even make sense to talk about this property at all.

240,1548348117.9131,Simon,"I like the never type, though it should probably get first class type system treatment vs an interesting hack on the inference system. Then it’d free up Elm to help folks a little bit more in the other dimensions"

240,1548348199.9138,Karrie,brilliant! :slightly_smiling_face:; how can I convert it to a readable datetime though? (from frontend)
240,1548348798.9142,Virgie,you mean more readable than YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ?; it depends a little bit on what you want really. The readme of elm/time has an example <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/>

241,1548352348.9157,Virgie,does it happen consistently?
241,1548352358.9159,Dede,100% of the time with the file at this point.
241,1548352404.9161,Virgie,(that is relevant because MVars are used in distributing work over multiple cores); if there's not a duplicate then sure report it.; and if you have a good reproducable example than share it regardless
241,1548352695.9168,Dede,"I had initially thought there wasn't a duplicate, but focusing on the MVar helped.  This is probably what's going on: <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1748>

243,1548365915.9185,Niesha,"Basically, one thread crashes with an exception because someone is using an unsafe operation, and then the deadlock detection kicks in - that's the MVar part."
244,1548367365.9188,Freda,Usually I've seen Evan tell people to create an issue if an SSCCE is available regardless whether one already exists in order to have more data on the matter.
245,1548375654.9207,Bernardo,"Is it considered bad form to have an `init` which says, e.g. {model = []}, but also has a command which does some HTTP and sends back the ‘actual’ values for `model`?; Because: I’m having trouble with :arrow_up: , where the ‘actual’ values are loaded and sent back through a port (AFAICT from the JS side), but the model is never updated :disappointed:; It occurs to me now I could just defer initializing the Elm app and send the ‘actual’ values through as a flag, but I wanted to see if there’s a consensus on this? :thinking_face:"
245,1548376081.9254,Earlean,<@Bernardo> that's fine. It's not uncommon to have `init` produce a value for the model that shows it in a loading state and http requests to fetch data
245,1548376502.9279,Bernardo,"<@Earlean> okay. So now the mystery begins: I switched to the ‘just send an initial value in flags’ approach and it works fine, so:
Are there any known issue with having commands in initializers tripping over initial model values?; If I fire off the command via e.g. a button, it works just fine, it just fails to do anything when I use it in `init` :thinking_face:"
246,1548376810.9304,Carrol,"Is that the root `init`? If inside a module, maybe is not wired up with the top init"
245,1548376863.9313,Bernardo,"Yep, root `init`, I’m a bit of newbie, so this is my first Elm project, but still just one file and one `init` :slightly_smiling_face:; I’ll try to make a repro."
245,1548377351.9337,Earlean,"<@Bernardo> commands aren't going to see you model value, the command will produce a Msg value that will be passed to your `update` function; I see you mentioned you are using a port. Have you subscribed to the port in your `subscriptions`?"
245,1548377407.9358,Bernardo,"Yeah, so I _presume_ `update` gets the message back via the port call in JS (which is triggered by the command fired off in the init); And that bit of `update` logic updates the model, but view doesn’t seem to change :grimacing:"
245,1548377455.9376,Earlean,You send on a port with a command and receive from ports via `subscriptions`
245,1548377465.9378,Bernardo,Yep; What’s extra weird is: <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C0CJ3SBBM/p1548376731929100>
245,1548377528.9391,Earlean,Do both the command and the button click produce the same Msg value?; Look at the case for the Msg value that your command would produce in your `update`
245,1548377906.9406,Bernardo,"Yeah, same Msg; I’m just whipping up a repro in Ellie; Of course I’m sure I won’t be able to repro :joy:"
245,1548378110.9423,Earlean,"Ah, are you sending to the port in JS immediately after initialising the Elm app?; Sending to a port before Elm is ready doesn't work."
245,1548378342.9451,Bernardo,"<@Earlean> so that’s what I was doing at first, and I had the same behavior, which made me thing, _I know, I’ll have a command fire in `init` to trigger the HTTP and port send back, that way I can be sure Elm is ready_. But that didn’t work :disappointed:; Aaaand, it works as expected in my Ellie app :grimacing: <https://ellie-app.com/4xNRkmBRp2Va1>; Who knows, I must have done something silly in my actual app.; Sorry and thanks for putting up with me!"
247,1548389681.947,Bernardo,"This: <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/774>, specifically not being able to use a `type alias` as the key in a `Dict` seems crazy to me. Am I missing something?"
245,1548390049.9481,Earlean,"<@Bernardo> It's not related to `type alias` at all, it's about which types are `comparable`"
247,1548390102.9492,Earlean,"some of the built in types are `comparable`, they have some reasonable ordering. `Int`, `String` etc. are `comparable`; By user defined types and records don't have a reasonable default ordering so you'd need some way to specify some how they should be ordered"
247,1548390236.9516,Kris,"Most do have a reasonable ordering, it's just not the way it works"
247,1548390349.9532,Earlean,<@Bernardo> the way similar languages do this is by having types implement some kind of interface (a type class) that defines how values of that type should be ordered. Which leads us in to the discussion of why Elm doesn't have user definable or implementable type classes.; There are a few packages that provide wrappers around `Dict` that take a function of `(k -&gt; comparable)` so you can specify some function for converting your key values from some type to a type that is comparable. eg. <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/turboMaCk/any-dict>
248,1548404925.9555,Nana,"However, using `[]` to represent ""waiting for data"" is kind of bad form. <http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html>"
248,1548405808.9558,Desire,not excited about the asset handling
248,1548415556.9562,Nana,"<@Renda> I can report that elm-ui has been really nice so far! definitely the way to go for styling in Elm; especially compared to the alternatives (I was pretty happy with component-scoped Stylus in Vue, but I found elm-css quite awkward in comparison, and elm-css-modules seems more like a workaround for when you already have tons of stylesheets that you don't want to rewrite); encountered one limitation so far: the tables currently don't support adding styles or event handlers to rows, only cells
I was able to work around it though; and the row/column/padding/spacing/align system is just perfect!"
248,1548418975.9572,Renda,<@Nana> hey that's great to hear! I can't wait to try it! But do you feel Elm-UI is better than SFC + stylus in Vue? (Since you said Elm-css was worse)
248,1548419184.9574,Nana,<@Renda> yeah probably; and definitely if you don't have years of experience with css
248,1548419234.9578,Renda,I have not looked into it but how doesnt it actually work? Is the styling done via JavaScript and absolute positionings or is the output clever css?; I'm definetly worst at css :stuck_out_tongue:
248,1548419344.9582,Nana,"it mostly uses css flexboxes, but with a nicer API"
248,1548419448.9584,Renda,Ok cool :slightly_smiling_face:
249,1548420317.9592,Juliann,Hello! Is there a way to make it so Elm does not overwrite the value of inputs when `update` is called?
248,1548420406.961,Antonette,"<@Juliann> quite possibly, depending on what you mean by that. Is the problem that when you change your model, you have in your view inputs whose `value` attribute is set to the model's data?"
248,1548420415.9614,Juliann,"The value is unchanging; Yet it is reset each time update is called; I'm suddenly realising that maybe `Html.Keyed` will help here as without it Elm can't avoid re-rendering my entire view, let me quickly try that"
249,1548420499.9642,Antonette,First thing that comes to mind is you could just not set the `value` attribute in your inputs. They won't change when the model changes.
248,1548420549.9649,Antonette,Why don't you want your inputs to reflect your model's data though?
248,1548420667.9655,Juliann,"I need to set the initial value, can that be done without value?; And because the value isn't used afterwards by Elm, it's a normal HTML form"
248,1548420727.9662,Antonette,Ok.
248,1548420822.9685,Earlean,"<@Juliann> all inputs in Elm are controlled inputs, the `view` is a reflection of the `model`"
248,1548420837.9688,Antonette,You might have misunderstood something about the way Elm works ; the view is not just generated when you start the application. It's re-generated every time your model changes.
248,1548420886.9702,Juliann,"Yes, but it does incremental rebuilding; I thought that it would be smart enough to not rewrite this if the diff showed no change"
248,1548420913.9718,Antonette,"Which, in turns, means that if you don't change your model when you put something in your input fields, and the view sets the value from the model's data, then every time something in your model changes, your view will be updated back to the model's initial value."
248,1548420922.9721,Juliann,I'll try forcing it with lazy
248,1548420925.9722,Earlean,What problem are you seeing that you're trying to avoid?
248,1548421033.9729,Juliann,"Input for which state have not changed are being re-rendered, causing their updated value to be reset"
248,1548421099.9734,Earlean,"if they're unchanged, aren't they at their reset value?"
248,1548421140.9737,Juliann,"No, because inputs can be updated outside of Elm"
248,1548421200.9745,Earlean,inputs being updated will produce a `input` event that you can listen for in Elm
248,1548421241.9752,Juliann,"And then I need to manage the state of this entire form, which would double the size of this program; Elm used to support this -&gt; <https://github.com/elm/html/commit/4912804dadbb2e7cdb6effa8ee737d2e08a96247>"
248,1548421269.9759,Earlean,"Yes, if you have a form that you're rendering from Elm you should be storing it's state in the Elm model"
248,1548421603.9782,Juliann,"I would agree if Elm did anything with it; Elm is responsible for perhaps 5% of the state here, the rest is plain old HTML; It's reinventing the wheel; And until 0.19 this was supported"
248,1548421660.9795,Virgie,"you can recreate the defaultValue property yourself; on the other hand: if elm renders it, then elm does do something with it right?"
248,1548421783.9808,Juliann,"It's a javascript element property, not a html property, so you cannot; I may be stuck here, sadly; I'm confused as to why `lazy` doesn't work"
248,1548421856.9823,Virgie,I'm not sure what you mean by that? you can implement the `defaultValue` as it existed in 0.18 yourself in 0.19
248,1548421946.9834,Juliann,"You cannot, it uses a Kernel module to set javascript properties on the virtual DOM. Only `elm/*` packages can do this"
248,1548421980.9839,Virgie,"e.g.
```
import VirtualDom

defaultValue : String -&gt; Attribute msg	
defaultValue v =	
  VirtualDom.property ""defaultValue"" (Encode.string v)
```; yes but the  kernel functionality is exposed, with exactly this sort of use case in mind"
248,1548422053.9848,Juliann,"ooh, that's different from the way it is defined in core; let's try that :slightly_smiling_face:"
248,1548422076.9854,Virgie,it should be similar to the way it was defined in 0.18
248,1548422150.9861,Juliann,"In 0.18 it uses the Kernel module while other the other properties use the method you've shown; It works, wonderful; Thank you so much; :heart:"

254,1548463103.0002,Loyce,"Hi folks! I have a somewhat interesting question. I'm writing a parser (using `elm/parser`) for a fairly simple syntax I've written for commands, which is sort of like a command line if you will with the possibility of multiple statements. Some of those statements will ultimately mutate some of the global state (add items for example), and then future statements might refer to those items added. In an Elm-esque way, i'm trying to figure out how to have a sort of ""new stuff created"" stack as part of the parser, so that I can check the *real* state and also check the *will be created but not created yet* state to let the user know about potential errors prior to running their commands; I'm not really sure how to go about that, somehow perhaps passing a simplistic model throughout all the parsers?"
254,1548463552.0034,Bebe,"I guess there are many ways to do the same thing but I would keep the parsers about just parsing and creating the AST and then I’d do the type checking or interpretation part, which would raise those errors you are talking about if everything parsed correctly "
254,1548463578.0038,Loyce,"So do a first pass; Then run it through another piece that will take that and do a sort of ""fake"" execution; and then assuming that checks out, do the real execution; That makes sense I think; once I have my Statement objects etc and I run them through a checker, I would be able to keep whatever state necessary; Thanks!"

267,1548671387.0811,Olevia,(<https://pastebin.com/45QLqyf4>) I have a snippet here which takes a rowindex and col index and attempts to update a `Array (Array a` (grid.rows). I feel like I'm doing it right but it's not working. The error message indicates that the argument is Row while it's expecting an Array of Cells. Which again makes sense because Row is a type alias with some extra state involved. My question is how can I change it so that it maps over the entire record but leaves everything except for the inner array as it was?
267,1548671917.0826,Antonette,"@Sybil consider this :

    in
    { grid | rows = updatedRows }
```; (this is just a simple refactor extracting the index update mechanism); First thing I noticed that made me question what's happening here is that you were putting the updated rows in a var named `updatedGrid` ; I supposed that you had tried to return this (which is not a grid) instead of an updated version of your grid (which your function declares it returns), and fell back to returning the original grid when this was not working to your satisfaction (and probably not compiling)."

267,1548672132.0868,Olevia,"so I kind of lied, since the rows isnt a Array (Array Cell) but rather a Array(Row) which is a record with Array Cell"

updateAtIndex transformation targetIndex =
    Array.indexedMap

267,1548674732.1133,Antonette,That's what happens when you're using real-world complicated structures like a form composed of different types of questions which have in turn possible answers which can be composed of various fields which in turn may have multiple associated data.; (which happens to be the case that made me reach out for Elm-Monocle and even contribute to it occasionally)

267,1548674935.1164,Antonette,"I didn't mean to imply you haven't. I meant to express that sometimes, you need deeply nested data structures.; (and with such cases, it's useful to have something that helps you traverse them); The case I'm referring to (for context) was such that we had an endpoint to pick up a form to edit, and an endpoint to save said form in its integrity. Making smaller endpoints to save only parts of the form and building it incrementally on the backend was not an option, so we had to have a structure that represented the form. Such a structure was deeply nested by design, and there was no way around it. Using optics helped us de-clutter the code tremendously.; Also, another place where optics came up really, really handy is video-games, where a whole world of data lives in a more or less deeply nested structure and accessing the parts you need can become tedious and error-prone really fast.; And I agree <@Bert> that keeping things small and shallow is the way to avoid useless complications and build more robust software whenever you can :wink:"

274,1548703253.1592,Euna,anyone have any good idea on how to refresh short term access tokens and have it propogate down to children?; also:  is this explanation still relevant in .19?; <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/48pqsh/updated_nested_child_components/d0n3n0v/>
274,1548704749.1607,Dede,"I feel like the most Elm-ish thing to do would be to keep the tokens at the top level of model and have the children just grab them from there, no?"
274,1548705057.1613,Carman,"There is no such thing as ""component state"" in Elm. All state lives on a single top-level model.; you may be passing different sub-chunks of that model into various view functions; which may feel like ""component state"" from other frameworks; but it's important to remember that at the end of the day it's a single big state; You generally want to keep that state DRY (Elm folks might say ""make impossible states impossible""); So you'd want to avoid duplicating tokens all over your model. Ideally the token lives in a single place"
275,1548705813.1648,Euna,"guys, I mean that the whole point. What I'm saying is there a way to take the top level Msg (Result Err a) and update the child components without have to pattern match every sub model"
274,1548705860.1659,Euna,I would like to avoid pattern matching two different Msg to every submodel
274,1548705886.1666,Bert,"If you do have pages with their own Model and Msg types, this example app I have may be helpful: <https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-shared-state>"
274,1548705892.1668,Euna,"I've been using feldman's SPA app as reference, but as far as I can tell he doesn't update tokens during the session"
274,1548706120.168,Earnest,"<@Euna> Store the token in your top-level `Model`, pass the token to the child `update` functions when you call them. Then you only have to update a single field when it changes."
274,1548706505.1688,Dede,"<@Euna> When you say ""component"" -- do you mean pages in an SPA, or something more like datepickers?"
276,1548706518.1691,Dede,Or something else?
274,1548706581.1695,Euna,"<@Dede> i mean children/page sure; None; the reason this is coming up is that I have refreshing the tokens on a timed task, so its a top level subscription"
274,1548706823.1724,Dede,"In the rtfeldman SPA, I think you'd have the top level update function call `toSession` (is that right?  This is from memory) to get the session, update the token in the session, and then re-build the current page (probably another big `case` statement) passing in the new session."
277,1548706906.1738,Jae,"Hi, there there a way to send a Cmd that doesn't do anything other than trigger a new update?  I know I can just call my `update` function directly but what I want is for the message to appear in the debugger history"
274,1548706985.1747,Euna,"<@Jae> you can make a cmd that takes in nothing, the NoOp causes a refresh iirc; * the NoOp from the elm-tutorial"
274,1548707071.1755,Velia,"```
send : msg -&gt; Cmd msg
send msg =
    Task.succeed msg
        |&gt; Task.perform identity
```
This is not good practice though."
277,1548707079.1758,Earnest,<@Jae> `Task.succeed () |&gt; Task.perform (always &lt;| myActualMsg)`
274,1548707306.1761,Euna,hot damn that's good
274,1548707389.177,Earnest,"Yeah, making it a `NoOp` won't do anything... I think they want to call the code from a specific update branch"
274,1548707407.1775,Euna,oooo
274,1548707423.1779,Earnest,"Well a proper NoOp at least, `NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)`; That said, I usually refactor the branch into a separate function and call it from both branches instead of recursive updates or sending Cmds."
277,1548707670.1799,Jae,"Yup, that works. Thanks! (Don't worry, I plan to use it for debugging only); That works, thanks!"
274,1548708122.1809,Euna,<@Dede> he batches session changes as a subscription to each page in order to not redraw it; I think I might do that too; I don't think I'm fluent enough to come up with a more elegant solution; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
278,1548717315.1828,Raylene,"I'm trying to install ""elm/bytes"", but I get the error: ""WARNING: I normally check &lt;https://package.elm-lang.org&gt; for new packages

278,1548717698.1834,Earlean,<@Raylene> are you behind a proxy server? 
279,1548731420.1863,Marcus,"I have a quick scaling/decomposition question. I have an app that does search. It allows a user to build a query and then it shows the results. The file is huge (several thousand lines), so I'm breaking it up into some modules. Specifically, I'm going to move the search results type into its own module, along with the decoders, http method, etc.; My question is this. Getting the results depends upon the model in my Main file. I don't want to set up a circular dependency. Can I just be careful with my `exposings` and include `Main` in `SearchResults`, or do I need to move my model into its own file also?"
279,1548731853.1884,Earlean,<@Marcus> if you've got code that depends on the Main model then it should probably be in the Main module.
279,1548731882.1893,Marcus,"Well, everything is in the Main module now."
279,1548731918.1899,Earlean,"But, if your model is a record type alias you could use the 'extensible record' syntax to depend only on the fields you need to"
279,1548731938.1905,Marcus,Good point. I underuse that feature.
279,1548751863.1916,Antonette,"<@Marcus> another way to see it is to decouple your model from your `Main` module, so it's accessible by both the `Main` module and the `SearchResults` without circular dependencies."
280,1548753153.1964,Dorsey,"Hi! Do you know of any REPL in the browser solution?; If I understand correctly Ellie compiles Elm code on the client side. Is there something like that for REPL? The only thing I could find is this <http://elmrepl.cuberoot.in/>, but it seems to connect to some server to evaluate the code.

280,1548753446.1983,Dorsey,Yes it would :smile:
280,1548753449.1985,Nana,like `Debug.type`
280,1548753479.1987,Dorsey,"I think it may be difficult. The types don't make it to the runtime, AFAIK."
280,1548753538.1989,Nana,yeah true
280,1548753547.1991,Dorsey,"I dream of an Elm with Lisp-like powers, where you can evaluate Elm expressions within a running Elm program.; Ah, the source code is here: <https://github.com/girishso/elm-repl-in-browser>; As I thought, it's connecting to REPL running in a container. Not ideal, but I guess good enough."
281,1548755234.1999,Huong,Ellie also compiles server-side. The 0.19 compiler does tricks for efficiency which GHCJS can't handle.
280,1548755255.2001,Dorsey,"Oh, I see. Thanks."
282,1548755423.2018,Earnestine,"does anyone have a glue why the linear-algebra package does provide `add`, `sub` for vectors, but not `div` and `mul`? Am I missing something here?"
282,1548755536.2019,Antonette,"There is a reason why there is no vector division: <https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/111652/can-we-divide-two-vectors>; As for the products, all the products you need are there.; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/linear-algebra/latest/Math-Vector2#scale>; (product with a scalar ; if you want to divide by said scalar, you can scale by a fraction); <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/linear-algebra/latest/Math-Vector2#dot>; :point_up_2: And if you want to multiply two vectors between one another, there's the dot product.; :slightly_smiling_face:; (does it answer your question?)"

282,1548756242.2042,Dorsey,Nice link. Thanks.
282,1548756466.2044,Earnestine,"Ok, I see. I already assumed there's a reason. But in practice, how would you do this:
```
mousePos : Vec2

resolution : Vec2

normalizedMousePos : Vec2
normalizedMousePos = ?
```

of course, I can write a helper:
```
v2div : Vec2 -&gt; Vec2 -&gt; Vec2
v2div v1 v2 =
    vec2 (V2.getX v1 / V2.getX v2) (V2.getY v1 / V2.getY v2)

```
normalizedMousePos = v2div mousePos resoltution

282,1548757135.2052,Antonette,"(or maybe not ; I'm not sure ; just a sec); Maybe I wouldn't use `normalize` in the name ; `normalize` already exists and consists in turning a vector of arbitrary length into a unit vector (length == 1) without changing its angle.; Except for that, your v2div function is fine if that's what you want to achieve (i.e. having a vector representing the coordinates of the mouse relative to the screen width and height).; I'm a little curious as to what you're trying to achieve with this, but if it makes sense in your situation, go for it :slightly_smiling_face:; (and since there's no pre-built way to do this in the package, so there's no better way than your way as far as I know)"

  (True, False) -&gt; [ a, b, c, y ]

I usually if/case with the different lists, but that may lead to a lot of duplication for the common static element of the lists;

I saw people having a list of `(Boolean, A)` or `Maybe A` and then call `List.filter`. What do you use? :slightly_smiling_face:"
286,1548780089.2378,Kris,I'd go for list of maybes
287,1548780386.2396,Antonette,Hey <@Lilli> :slightly_smiling_face: I usually go for the `List (Maybe a)` (usually more readable imo) ; you may want to use `Maybe.Extra.values : List (Maybe a) -&gt; List a` that does pretty much what you would expect from its type signature.; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/maybe-extra/latest/Maybe-Extra#values>
287,1548780568.2417,Lilli,"<@Antonette> yea, i don't use it much because when you have a lot of common items you just end with too many ""Just"", in my example `[a, b, c]` are always there. But there are cases where it's super convenient and easy to read aswell"
287,1548780653.2431,Antonette,"The way I do it to avoid clutter is like:

287,1548781538.2503,Antonette,Yep. Even worse when you want the extra to appear at specific points. Even worse when there are lots of them.
287,1548781569.251,Earnest,"At that point I'd start writing functions that handle the conditional testing or switch to Maybe; And yeah if you need optional things in arbitrary positions instead of beginning or end, just use the filterMap"

```
[ (a, True)

287,1548781973.2585,Antonette,"I'm not a fan of ""polluting"" the dom tree with useless nodes ; at least the `List (Maybe a)` doesn't introduce long-living `Nothing` elements in a deep structure.; Still, if there was a value that says ""this is technically an `Html msg` but don't put it in the dom tree please"" I'd rather use that than a `List (Maybe a)`.; (like an `Hml.none` or something)"
287,1548782116.2613,Lilli,<@Rutha> never thought of that. So far i never encountered a situation where a tree would be clearer to read compared to a list

287,1548782155.2623,Antonette,Hmm. That's a great feature to have actually.
287,1548782187.2641,Carman,nodes _are_ trees :slightly_smiling_face:
287,1548782191.2644,Nana,"but not just that, you could create a generic ""optional"" function, like my `nodeIf` example, but which returned `[]` if False, so it'd work on all lists!"
287,1548782199.2647,Antonette,Like `(::) : a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a` we could have a `(:?) : Maybe a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a` for example.
287,1548782247.2661,Carman,They already work like how <@Nana> suggests except that you need to wrap the lists in a node; I guess it doesn't flatten though
287,1548782336.2672,Nana,"so you could then write:
```
[ a
, b
, c

a

:? Nothing -- won't count
:? optionallyC -- optionallyC being a Maybe of the right type
:: []

287,1548782567.2721,Lilli,here you're basically creating many lists (one for each row). i'm not sure if there are some optimizations that could happen at runtime
287,1548782578.2723,Antonette,"Oh, no.; Each element in this list is an item of the list (since `(::) : a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a` it just appends an item to the list).; `(:?) : Maybe a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a` is different in that it takes a `Maybe a` and only appends to the list if it's a `Just` and not a `Nothing`."
287,1548782670.2748,Carman,yes if you use a `Maybe` under the hood.
287,1548782673.275,Nana,what's nice about the spread operator though is that you wouldn't have to use `filterMap` or whatever on the list afterwards
287,1548782699.2762,Lilli,"yea, but lists are immutable in elm. when you append to a list, you're actually creating a new list with 1 more item in the end"
287,1548782701.2764,Carman,to allow multiple items you'd probably want `List` under the hood in which case `conditionalList` is `List.concat`
287,1548782714.2769,Antonette,Same with something like the `(:?)` idea.
287,1548782718.2771,Nana,I feel like first constructing a list and then filtermapping it to a different type of list becomes kind of indirect
287,1548782797.2786,Carman,Needing to do logic inline in a list like that is a bit of a smell IMO. It's not _bad_ but when I see that I pause to see if I can move that elsewhere.
287,1548782806.2789,Antonette,Sure ; it's an idea for cases where these are not very long lists though.
287,1548782808.2792,Carman,Many conditionals can be pushed up higher in the decision tree
287,1548782880.2807,Antonette,"(and it's only the case because Elm doesn't do optimization like in Haskell, in which `a : b : c` is the same as `[a, b, c]`, memory serves)"
287,1548782931.282,Nana,"<@Carman> I think it makes sense for html nodes / attributes though
it's nice to have ""linear"" code where you don't have to jump around to read it; which I think is a bit of a problem with moving the logic elsewhere"
287,1548782965.283,Antonette,"Plus, you can use names to push the specifics up in a `let` rather than putting the condition in the list itself."
287,1548783004.2839,Carman,"I agree but that leads me to the opposite conclusion :smile:. Having ""linear"" code in your view is why I like moving the logic up"
287,1548783100.2847,Nana,I guess it's just because I'm so used to writing HTML templates :thinking_face: so I try to write Elm node lists in the same way
287,1548783224.2863,Antonette,"(also, <@Nana>, you're entitled to your preferences as long as it fits your teams' :wink:)"
287,1548783535.2927,Carman,"I'm a big fan of the idea of separating conditional logic from the implementation of each path. This is especially powerful if you start repeating conditionals. For example:
```
message : Bool -&gt; Html a
message condition =
  div (if condition then [class ""active""] else [])
    (if condition then [ text ""true"" ] else [ text ""false"" ])
```

is much easier to read if we separate the conditional logic from the branches

```
message : Bool -&gt; Html a
message condition =
  if condition then
    activeMessage
  else
    inactiveMessage

activeMessage : Html a
activeMessage =
  div [class ""active""] [ text ""true"" ]

inactiveMessage : Html a
inactiveMessage =
  div [ ] [ text ""false"" ]
```; I guess this is related to the idea of keeping code in a function at a single level of abstraction"
287,1548783666.2948,Velia,"On a side note, beware, `nodeIf/viewIf` can be devastating for performance if it is used for a complex node (for example a full page with `elm-css` styling). Be sure to use a lazy version like <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/html-extra/latest/Html-Extra#viewIfLazy> for example when you want to avoid evaluating the node."
287,1548783787.2966,Carman,"I take a similar approach to case statements:
```
case maybe of
  Nothing -&gt; emptyState
  Just item -&gt; viewItem item
```; Turns out doing this is super powerful, not just for views. Moving the conditional up in the decision tree removes a lot of the pain around working with Maybe; Tinkering with these ideas led to this article: <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/problem-solving-with-maybe> and this ElmEurope talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43eM4kNbb6c> :slightly_smiling_face:"

288,1548787926.3019,Lorilee,"It can look a bit nicer if you hide the if/else behind a function and use List.concat to keep it all lined up

289,1548788440.3033,Elliot,can I call `elm make` from another directory? I just get `It looks like you are starting a new Elm project. elm init` message … I can’t discover any flags :confused:
288,1548788520.3043,Carman,You can make files at an arbitrary path but `elm make` must be run from the directory that contains the project's `elm.json`
288,1548788567.3049,Elliot,okay! thank you for confirming that :blush:
289,1548803594.3092,Marcus,"I've got another question related to splitting things up. I had a giant `Main.elm`. It's an app for letting a user search and then displaying those search results. The seam I split the file apart on was on my SearchResults type. There are a bunch of types that it included in it and it's a nicely contained part of the app. The only place where there is some leakage is in my `getSearchResults` method. The signature for it is `getSearchResults : SearchQuery -&gt; Cmd Msg`. `Msg` is defined in `Main.elm`. I'm not crazy about needing to pull `Msg` out into its own file to prevent circular dependencies. So, I think I have two options, leave `getSearchResults` in `Main.elm` or use a type placeholder for `Msg`. Any recommendations?; Side note, I just tried the type placeholder approach and I'm still picking compiler errors out of my forehead."
289,1548804102.3128,Huong,"You could try doing something like `getSearchResults : SearchQuery -&gt; (SearchResults -&gt; msg) -&gt; Cmd msg`. Not sure if that's what you meant by 'type placeholder', but it seems like a decent API"
289,1548804270.3131,Marcus,"""Type variable"" is what I meant.; That does look like a good API. So, is the second param a function that takes a `SearchResults` and returns a message?; Ah, I got it to work, although I don't understand the syntax entirely."
289,1548805354.3149,Kris,Which part?
289,1548805988.3168,Elvis,"Hullo all - I'm implementing drag-and-drop that should interoperate with other software. In the past, I've used something like `onDragStart(e) =&gt; e.dataTransfer.setData(""custom/mime-type"", value)` and `val = dataTransfer.getData(""custom/mime-type"")` over in the receiver but this is feeling pretty janky in Elm right now. Has anyone else solved this problem?; In particular, I've noticed that I can use a gross manual HTML attribute to ""shell out"" and set the custom data on the dragStart event but it's not clear to me how I could decode the data out of the event on the flip side. Advice or links are welcome!"
289,1548807158.3172,Marcus,"<@Kris> The type definition. The definition of the method in my module is this:

```
getSearchResults : SearchQuery -&gt; (Result Http.Error SearchResults -&gt; msg) -&gt; Cmd msg

```
getSearchResults model.searchQuery NewResults

The second parameter of the method is tripping me up a bit."
289,1548807215.3182,Kris,It's just a function `Result Http.Error SearchResults -&gt; msg` like you said
289,1548807522.3213,Marcus,"Yeah, I just haven't internalized that syntax. I can give the definition of what it is doing, but can't give a nuanced explanation. It will come."

292,1548836096.3276,Earlean,<@Norris> <https://github.com/elm/browser/tree/master/src/Debugger>; and <https://github.com/elm/browser/blob/master/src/Elm/Kernel/Debugger.js>
292,1548836275.3297,Norris,"ah thank you! I'm looking for it because there is an issue with the `File.Select.file` code on certain browsers (e.g. safari on iOS), and it appears the issue can be mitigated by temporarily appending an input element to the DOM and then removing it. I noticed that this is exactly what the Debugger kernel code does.; Here's the `elm/file` issue I'm referencing, which I just posted my quick-and-dirty fix in: <https://github.com/elm/file/issues/4>"
293,1548837636.3305,Saran,"is `text """"` even added to the dom?"
294,1548838662.3324,Nana,I heard there were plans to make the compiler detect functions and give a type error if you try to compare them? Could that also mean that all types which don't contain functions would be moved into `comparable`? :slightly_smiling_face:
293,1548838705.3328,Antonette,"That's a good question <@Saran> and I'm not sure. Still, I prefer having an `Element.none` that says it's no element than a `text """"` that's a little bit less clear on why it's here."
294,1548838719.3332,Nana,So then we could have native any-dicts!
293,1548838797.3333,Nana,"<@Antonette> I actually considered defining `none = text """"` for myself hehe"
293,1548838853.3335,Saran,"yeah, it should be a zero element"
294,1548838956.3351,Earlean,`comparable` is kind of a confusing name. It's types where `&lt;` and `&gt;` and `==` are defined
294,1548839033.3368,Nana,"<@Earlean> indeed, but if you know there are no functions, you could use an internal function like `Debug.toString` and then maybe put it through a hashing function; or would it be too ""weird"" that users could use `&gt;` and `&lt;` on random types?"
294,1548839195.3394,Norris,"`comparable` required ordering, and custom types don't have an order, unless the compiler assumes the order is the one in which they are defined, e.g. `type Custom = First | Second | Third`, and then `First &lt; Second`; off the top of my head, that's how Haskell works if you define a custom data type with the `Ord` typeclass"
294,1548839296.3407,Nana,"<@Norris> I was thinking it would just be an arbitrary ordering, only really used for performance in data structures; maybe it could have an alternate API instead of `&gt;` and `&lt;` though"
294,1548839355.3415,Norris,"then you just want equality; not orderability; which Elm doesn't have; again to go back to Haskell, there's `Eq` and there's `Ord`; one gives you `==`, the other gives you `&gt;` and `&lt;`; but `Ord` requires `Eq`"
294,1548839445.344,Nana,"<@Norris> but orderability can give you better performance for lookups
example: <https://github.com/pzp1997/assoc-list/blob/master/Performance.md>"
294,1548840473.3457,Lynne,I think it is generally hard (if not impossible) to come with both fast and reliable hashing function for arbitrary data
295,1548840568.3468,Lynne,"If you convert elements to string and use, say, md5 hash (or whatever else out there without collisions), creation and insertion will be a major bottleneck"
294,1548840663.3471,Nana,<@Lynne> yeah that may be true
295,1548840702.3475,Lynne,Not to mention that comparing large strings is not that efficient
294,1548840889.3487,Lynne,In Java class designers are encouraged to provide `equals` and `hashCode` methods if they intend to use objects as Map keys; It must have been done for a reason given the language's history
294,1548841032.3497,Huong,"That requires information to be present at runtime which isn't present at runtime, such as the names of the constructors. With `--optimize`, those are stripped so you can have smaller artifacts. Additionally, the compiler does unboxing in `--optimize` mode, meaning something aren't even in a ""box"" anymore. I.e. `type Foo = Foo String` will result in plain, bare strings being used, rather than objects that contain a string."
294,1548841040.3499,Nana,"<@Lynne> hmm, in other languages, Enums are often stored as Ints. perhaps something similar could be used for custom types?"
294,1548841094.3511,Timika,"That is what Elm compiles them to when you don’t add values to them. If they carry values however, they become objects to allow for this. :slightly_smiling_face:"
294,1548841185.3527,Nana,"Debug.toString was just an example, it wouldn't have to be the actual name, just some kind of unique thing"
294,1548841196.3531,Timika,So that would only work for _enum-like_ custom types. I can vaguely remember a discussion about this.
294,1548841197.3532,Lynne,"Yeah, since we are talking only about custom types converting to ints might be a way to go if only they did not have arguments :slightly_smiling_face:"
294,1548841335.3551,Nana,"but if I had:
```
type Foo = Foo
type Bar a = Bar a
```
then `Bar Foo` could still probably be converted into a more clever thing than an object, maybe some mathematical operation combining the Int representations of `Foo` and `Bar` ?; probably way faster than big String comparisons, though could still get slow on large structures"
294,1548841414.3569,Timika,"I was referring to smth like `type Foo = Bar Int | Baz String | Quu Gender`, where the solution is not obvious, at least to me."
294,1548841421.3571,Lynne,And in case of `Bar SomeLongRecord`?
294,1548841454.3578,Nana,<@Lynne> yeah it could still get slow
294,1548841473.3585,Lynne,"Not even slow, how would you assign a number in this case?; It is pretty simple when using enum-like types or types which only take enum-like types, but then such a restriction should appear in the language"
294,1548841533.3604,Timika,"I think this is one of the problems that look easy to solve until you dive a bit deeper, then they become super hard, especially when you factor in elegance of design and ergonomics."
294,1548841539.3606,Lynne,So pretty much extend `comparable` to enum-like types and we are good to go; Still won't be super useful though :slightly_smiling_face:
294,1548841721.3623,Nana,"<@Lynne> though it'd probably be bad to have this feature for enum-likes only. That'd make other custom types a bit of a second-class citizen, which would encourage worse code; so yeah :pensive:"
294,1548841756.3629,Lynne,"That's why I said it won't be super useful; I use `Uuid` and would be happy having them as dict keys; But `Uuid` is not an enum-like type; And, generally speaking, it is not possible to come with an integer number for it, only some float (probably with double precision); (I mean an integer which would fit into `Int` type)"
294,1548842122.3664,Nana,"<@Lynne> hmm, so for you, `AssocList` could actually be faster than `Dict String Stuff` ? :thinking_face:; because `==` doesn't do a full string comparison to check wether too Uuids are equal, right?"
294,1548842343.3676,Lynne,How do you mean it does not do full string comparison?
294,1548842381.3685,Nana,or maybe it does? don't know how it works
294,1548842382.3686,Lynne,"If custom types are represented as JS objects then Kernel will do structural comparison, i.e. it will compare strings; But I don't know how they are represented in 0.19. In 0.18 they were objects if I remember correctly"
294,1548842465.37,Nana,"but with immutable datastructures, aren't you supposed to be able to check equality by just checking the top node?"
294,1548842485.3702,Lynne,Could you elaborate on this?
294,1548842538.3712,Earlean,"<@Nana> yes, you can do reference comparisons, but that's only helpful if these data structures are related in some way"
294,1548842543.3713,Timika,They still are in cases where you have a value with them. Otherwise `--optimize` will make them numbers.
294,1548842563.3717,Earlean,eg. if one is a slightly modified version of the other
294,1548842569.3718,Lynne,"Thanks, good to know :+1:; Not sure I understood you <@Earlean>"
294,1548842693.3746,Bert,"If you have `a = [1, 2]` and `b = [1, 2]`, they will be two different references but equal in value."
294,1548842725.375,Lynne,"That's why there is structural comparison, right?; `Basics.eq` is actually doing reference comparison as first step (pretty logical) before it dives deeper in the structure"
294,1548842756.3762,Nana,<@Lynne> I just remember Immutable.js presenting this as an advantage
294,1548842757.3765,Lynne,I mean JS function which `Basics.eq` is backed by
294,1548842779.3774,Nana,"<@Bert> yeah that makes sense, so I guess you can quickly prove a positive, but not a negative"
294,1548842789.3776,Lynne,"<@Nana> It is very possible I am just not sure I understood what ""top node"" is"
294,1548842819.3781,Bert,"Right. Think of an immutable linked list.; Prepend an item and you have a longer linked list, but the ""top node"" is now different"
294,1548842906.3799,Lynne,"If it is a graph node, then, yes, in case of immutable data structures simple reference comparison of the node says if you need to dive deeper to the children"
294,1548843135.3817,Nana,"right, so I guess when you use `==` on two `Uuid`s,  would it first check reference equality, but if that returns false, it'd to a full structural comparison? so when going through a list to find a match, you wouldn't get any benefit from it"
294,1548843158.3821,Lynne,That's exactly what `Basics.eq` is doing; <https://github.com/elm/core/blob/22b2d7a235003a88af4e4af58c3d0edf43684bc9/src/Elm/Kernel/Utils.js#L35>

296,1548845857.3844,Karrie,"hello everyone!
is it possible to pattern match on a string in elm?
say I have a string that has a well defined structure and would like to extract the separate info from it?"
296,1548845952.3854,Nana,"<@Karrie> ah, not like that, you'll have to parse it into a record or something first; or just use Regex, that might be the simplest; (by pattern match I assume you meant `case .. of`)"
296,1548846264.3866,Lynne,"Sadly, pattern matching in Elm is not as powerful as in Elixir yet"
296,1548847022.3882,Karrie,"<@Nana> in elixir you can do `def my_func(""say:"" &lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;digit::bytes-size(1)&gt;&gt; &lt;&gt; "":"" &lt;&gt; thing) do ... end`; but I guess it’s not possible in elm yet
thanks <@Lynne> and <@Nana>!"
296,1548847317.3896,Jin,<@Karrie> You could write a parser using <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/> and pattern match on the result of `Parser.run`

297,1548851826.3931,Daysi,is there a way to trigger the `scrollIntoView()`-method of a DOM element rendered by Elm _without_ using ports (because ports need a full update -&gt; view circle with a model and stuff but I want to trigger the `scrollIntoView()` on a simple view-component without state)?; help would be greatly appreciated
297,1548852060.3939,Lynne,"That's not how Elm works, so not possible"
297,1548852079.3941,Daysi,wow
297,1548852132.396,Nana,hmm I think you can use `Browser.Dom.setViewPort` ?
297,1548852138.3962,Lynne,"You don't need model and stuff (can simply use `()` as your model) but you have to send some command to trigger side effects; <@Nana>, it is a `Task`, still not possible with just a view"
297,1548852230.3981,Nana,"yeah not just with view, that'd be weird anyway :stuck_out_tongue:"
297,1548852272.3985,Daysi,"the problem is I want to have a reusable state-less component, which handles the ""onClick"" independently from the client-code which uses it.

297,1548852393.4014,Nana,"<@Daysi> yes, your view component can take a ""message handler"" as an argument, which lets you do stuff like that"
297,1548852425.402,Daysi,how so?
297,1548852432.4022,Lynne,"Shortly, there is no ""private"" update functions"
297,1548852476.4035,Daysi,<@Lynne> no _exposed_ update function. You get what I mean... no?
297,1548852504.4041,Lynne,"All messages you send from your ""subcomponents"" (in Elm world there is a long-running discussion if ""component"" is an appropriate term at all) have to go via top-level program (client code in your terms  if I got you right); <@Daysi> I think I get, but, again, that's not how Elm works :slightly_smiling_face:"
297,1548852557.4054,Daysi,but it wouldn't make sense for the top-level program to handle stuff which belongs into the responsibilities of the view layer
297,1548852565.4058,Lynne,Who would be triggering this private function if it was there?
297,1548852577.4061,Daysi,the user
297,1548852588.4065,Lynne,"Programmaticaly; Given the Elm runtime and stuff; Well, the only thing top-level program needs to do in this case is to delegate certain messages to another module's `update` function; So you still have separation of concerns, it is just the message flow which always starts from top"
297,1548852699.4094,Daysi,"but the top-level program shouldn't be aware that there are any messages which don't concern it, i.e. `scrollIntoView()`; it should only care about business-related logic, not view-related logic"
297,1548852771.4111,Lynne,"Well, it does not have be aware of exact messages (is it `scrollIntoView` or `scrollOutOfView` should not concern it), but it has to be aware of the very presence of messages themselves; I hear OO in what you are saying :slightly_smiling_face:"
297,1548852990.4125,Nana,"<@Daysi> here's the most basic version of such a ""component"" <https://ellie-app.com/4BfGmGPKKdva1>; in the example it only returns it's new state, however it could also return other things like `(model, Cmd.msg)` which is how you can use Tasks like setting the viewport"
297,1548853247.4145,Daysi,"<@Lynne> *triggered*; :smile:; no seriously, I don't know why you hear OO; abstraction and encapsultion of reponsibility is a universal concept not related to OO or FP; <@Nana> thanks"
297,1548853361.4183,Lynne,"""business-related logic"", ""view-related logic"" are terms I've never heard since I started working with Elm; People just tend to call things differently here"
297,1548853430.4207,Nana,"with this type of ""mapping"" you can do encapsulation in Elm, and it lets you create ""components"" that can have private state and do effects. it's just that they always have to ""go through the parent"""
297,1548853437.421,Daysi,"that is a big problem in complex software as you run into huge files (""where did I put xy...?"") and naming difficulties. Also you mix up abstractions in your mind which can be puzzling; <@Lynne>"
297,1548853619.4239,Lynne,"I don't really want to discuss abstraction, encapsulation and other stuff which may or may not be a universal concept. This is philosophy to very large extent.; Elm architecture is simple and straightforward: you have a model, you update the model, you render the model"
297,1548853655.4256,Nana,"<@Lynne> I don't think you should say ""Elm doesn't do that"" though. it does, it just works a little differently"
297,1548853673.426,Lynne,<@Nana> I did not say that
297,1548853703.4265,Daysi,"to be fair, he said in Elm ""People just tend to call things differently"""
297,1548853753.4279,Lynne,"<@Daysi> Then, if you have some business-related logic, you generally create a module with functions encapsulating this logic and modifying your model or part of it, returning new one"
297,1548853794.4298,Daysi,"but the abstraction problem remains: the tabs should always scroll into view when the user clicks on them, regardless of where (in which top-level program) they are used; <@Lynne> yeah that is basic knowledge, no?"
297,1548853830.4315,Nana,"&gt; Sergey Zubtsovskiy [1:41 PM]
&gt; That's not how Elm works, so not possible
I think it's better to say ""You do that by mapping the update function"" or something"
297,1548853853.4321,Dayna,"<@Daysi> Disregarding all philosophical discussions, here's how you can achieve what you want in Elm: Define a Msg type for your component, then define an update function for those messages, then in your main function add a message with type of something like `MessageFromComponent ComponentMsg` and in the update function add `case MessageFromComponent msg -&gt; Component.update msg state` and you're done, that's all of the plumbing you have to do"
297,1548853890.4327,Daysi,that's not very elegant; :disappointed:
297,1548853905.4339,Lynne,"<@Daysi> that's true, I just wanted to address your concern about abstraction of business and view logic"
297,1548853914.4344,Daysi,so I have to handle these cases every time I use the component in a view
297,1548853937.4352,Dayna,"No need, you can have a single case for all components"
297,1548853954.4357,Nana,"<@Daysi> yeah it's a bit fiddly to set up, but it still seems the simplest solution for a pure functional language"
297,1548853965.4362,Daysi,<@Nana> yeah
297,1548853980.4368,Dayna,"If you just need a way to differentiate them, maybe make an opaque Id for each"
297,1548853990.437,Daysi,I think we have here a hot spot where FP and the DOM collide a little bit :confused:; I hate it since I love Elm otherwise and I wish there was a more elegant solution
297,1548854064.439,Lynne,Why is this solution not elegant?
297,1548854066.4393,Dayna,"Well you do really mind adding 3 lines of boilerplate to your main file, if you really do then you're not going to like the rest of Elm either"
297,1548854095.4398,Daysi,<@Dayna> I know Elm quite a bit by now and I can say for sure I love it
297,1548854126.4408,Lynne,It is just a way how single data flow is implemented. In React world there is Redux which does pretty much same thing.
297,1548854142.4412,Dayna,To be fair you would never do that in react + redux
297,1548854151.4414,Daysi,yep; I programmed with React and Redux for 6 years and I know it inside and out; but I guess I have to bite the bullet in this case. If I come across a better approach I'll tell you guys.; Thank you for your helps!
297,1548854236.4441,Lynne,So in React+Redux you would just call the JS function?
297,1548854241.4442,Daysi,<@Myong> seriously?
297,1548854344.4456,Dayna,"Even the most hardcore Elm-inspired redux people would probably call the js function before dispatching the action. There is no mechanism to treat the DOM API as a Task or side effect, you would have to do the wrapping yourself"
297,1548854439.4464,Lynne,"Yeah, I see, but anyway I mentioned Redux because it is generally built in a similar to Elm way.; Of course, it is not the same, I only meant idea of single data flow"
297,1548854478.4475,Dayna,"Even in Elm applications are stateful because the DOM has so much state, things like scroll positions, forms, media queries"
297,1548854570.448,Lynne,"Well, that's a web application after all."
297,1548854862.4485,Daysi,Maybe the `scrollIntoView` behav should even be in CSS :thinking_face:; idk; boundaries are blurring these days...; like `:active { scroll-into-view: true }` or something
297,1548854993.4514,Dayna,If we had a purely functional web (everything is data and in the model)  it would be absolutely amazing
297,1548855081.4529,Nana,"<@Daysi> hmm those scrolling tabs in the example were pretty terrible though :grimacing: you have to click them one by one to inch the view to the right, unless you're on a phone or laptop where you have horizontal scrolling gestures I guess"
297,1548855112.4534,Daysi,<@Nana> you can use Shift+Mouse Wheel; ^^; pretty intuitive imo; but that's just me; touch pad: swiping left/right should do the job
297,1548855168.4551,Nana,"<@Daysi> considering I didn't know that, I doubt many users know about that :stuck_out_tongue:"
297,1548855175.4553,Daysi,":thinking_face:; well, a couple of years ago I established an axiom for myself: If my mom can use it, anyone can use it"
297,1548855241.4571,Nana,"I think it's intuitive if you're making a mobile-only app, but otherwise I think it's pretty bad"
297,1548855256.4575,Daysi,I'll show it to my mom over the weekend and get back in touch with you :blush:
297,1548855279.4581,Nana,"<@Daysi> show it to her on a desktop computer then, not a phone"
297,1548855324.4589,Daysi,"when she can use it, you should consider changing to another profession than programming, e.g. backend :wink:"
297,1548855621.4595,Nana,horizontal scrolling without scrollbars is highly unusual on the web; to me it looks like an oversight by the developer
297,1548855831.4601,Daysi,but the developer is google
298,1548855890.4604,Danika,What are you discussing?
297,1548855938.4607,Daysi,material design scrollable tabs
297,1548855962.4615,Nana,<@Danika> the tabs at the bottom of this page <https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/#/component/tabs>
297,1548855968.4616,Daysi,<@Nana> you actually might be right! In the design guide lines they say that you should provide an indicator that you can scroll; <https://material.io/design/components/tabs.html#scrollable-tabs>; but they don't show it in the development/web/ section!; good catch actually :thinking_face:
297,1548856050.463,Danika,hmm
297,1548856072.4638,Daysi,but for this you would need JavaScript and were back at the start of our discussion again
297,1548856078.464,Danika,I wasn't even paying attention and instinctively swiped to scroll. But that is horrible UX for desktop.
297,1548856086.4642,Daysi,yeh; agree
297,1548856102.465,Nana,<@Daysi> told you :grin:
297,1548856108.4652,Danika,I think it's very obvious these design guidelines are geared towards mobile development though
297,1548856122.4656,Daysi,<@Danika> both actually; read on!
297,1548856169.4663,Danika,95% of the examples in the design spec are mobile layout
297,1548856212.467,Nana,"I'm not a huge fan of Material Design anyway, it's kind of weird to adopt another company's look and feel, unless you're specifically designing for Android"
297,1548856277.4687,Danika,"They addressed that with their refresh of Material that they launched, i want to say last year? It was never really fully intended to be cloned the way it was, and they've tried to make that clearer but not really succeeded; Also if you scroll down to the very very bottom and look at the actual design spec.; None; It's very obvious this spec is for mobile and desktop is like ""yeah you can make it look like that for desktop too."""
297,1548856412.4701,Daysi,None
297,1548856509.4721,Danika,I don’t think the design intention here is that you scroll. You click the indicator; I don’t think this is particularly relevant discussion for <#C0CJ3SBBM|general> though ^^
297,1548856565.4739,Daysi,"it is not possible to check in Elm if scrollWidth &gt; clientWidth, yes?; only with js interop; and ports"
297,1548856647.4759,Nana,"it's better with the indicator/scroll button, but even that looks pretty annoying to use. I'd only use it if I knew that in 80% of cases you wouldn't need to scroll, and have the indicator for those edge cases"
297,1548856728.476,Earnest,"I would use `text """"` because that is literally nothing in HTML, while `div [] []` still adds a node; And if you swap the order of arguments it might look nicer in use:
```
let 
  someConditionalHtml = maybeView2 maybeA maybeB &lt;| \a b -&gt;
      div [] [ text &lt;| a ++ b ]
```"
297,1548856848.4772,Daysi,it's such a bummer you cannot programmatically react to browser window rendering changes in Elm; only through ports
297,1548856907.4784,Nana,"<@Daysi> you don't need ports, there's a subscription for that"
297,1548856922.4789,Daysi,otherwise you'd need some kind of dependency injection of the whole DOM into view component
297,1548856928.4791,Cecile,"<@Daysi> by rendering changes, do you mean like viewport width/height?"
297,1548856937.4793,Daysi,<@Cecile>; yea; <@Nana> thanks! will look into it
297,1548856974.4803,Cecile,lol then I hope <@Leanna> is right
297,1548857019.4811,Nana,<@Daysi> `Browser.Events.onResize`
297,1548861351.4816,Daysi,yeah; but you cannot check if scrollWidth &gt; clientWidth of a specific element; you'd have to make the roundtrip through ports
297,1548861701.4845,Lynne,"<@Daysi> if it is a specific element you care about, you should be able to subscribe to `scroll` with `Html.Events.on`, extract both values and compare them, shouldn't you?; I did it in 0.18, this possibility is still there in 0.19; Not exactly this, I was using `scrollTop` but that's just another property"
297,1548862365.4869,Daysi,that's an interesting point but not quite what I was searching for. I need to render an element depending if scrollWidth &gt; clientWidth of another element
297,1548862442.488,Lynne,I see
297,1548862511.489,Daysi,but maybe I don't see a solution because I'm not familiar enough with the Html.Events module?
297,1548862523.4895,Nana,"<@Daysi> first set up a subscription to `Browser.Events.onResize`, then in the response handler, use `Browser.Dom.getViewportOf`; pretty fiddly but that should work I tihnk"
297,1548862540.49,Lynne,Are you aware of `Browser.Dom.getViewportOf` <@Daysi>?
297,1548862551.4903,Daysi,not until now
297,1548862555.4905,Lynne,Ah sorry <@Nana> did not see your message; I  think that's what you need then <@Daysi>. At least docs name `clientWidth` as one of the things you may get from it
297,1548862664.492,Daysi,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Dom#getViewportOf>; interesting :thinking_face:; maybe this helps already; Thanks guys!!; <@Myong> oh shut up!
297,1548862822.4939,Nana,"basically the same as in js really:
```
window.addEventListener(""resize"", () =&gt;
  document.getElementById(""myElement"").scrollWidth etc...
)
```; I guess it's mostly the Msg system that makes it feel fiddlier :thinking_face:"
297,1548863476.4953,Daysi,"oh; what if I subscribe to ""resize"" and the event fires _before_ the Elm app is rendered?; well, I could fire it via Cmd on init to be sure :thinking_face:"
299,1548863654.4977,Dede,"Start your app w/  Browser.Dom.getViewport; Wait,; sorry"
297,1548863671.4985,Dede,"I see that in history.; Well, I see getViewportOf in history.  getViewport will give you the Window dimensions.  I think if you combine that as an init-launched task with a subscription you should have total coverage."
297,1548864246.5006,Nana,"<@Daysi> yeah, same as in JS, whenever you add a listener to resize, you usually also need to run the code once right away; pretty common in JS:
```
const resizeHandler = () =&gt; document.getElementById(""myElement"").scrollWidth etc...
resizeHandlar()
window.addEventListener(""resize"", resizeHandler)
```"
300,1548865688.5036,Daysi,yeah right
301,1548867206.5053,Jalisa,"Hello there, just wanted to tell you that our CFP for Elm Europe is open ! We wrote some guidelines this year, hoping it will make this process clearer/simpler for everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://checkout.eventlama.com/#/events/elm-europe-2019/cfp>
Guidelines
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yt_IdGObx6u3BO3alkhBXqaxQM4Zx9fM/view?usp=sharing>"
297,1548870126.5069,Jin,"There is a typo in the guidelines. Should be 8th of March I guess. :slightly_smiling_face:
&gt; You have until the 8th of February if you want to have feedback, 1 week before the end of the CFP then."
301,1548876816.5075,Jalisa,"<@Jin> Absolutely, the changes have been made ! :slightly_smiling_face:"
302,1548888051.5096,Alison,"Hello! It's been &gt;1 year since I made a few tiny apps in Elm, and I'm curious if anyone has a good path for getting ramped back up again? Wanting to include Elm on an internal project at work once I am comfortable enough with it and patterns (project structure, etc). I'm going to Elm in the Spring in Chicago, as well, in April!"
303,1548890202.512,Jenice,"Hi all, I almost know I'll get no response for this but does anyone know if there has any been any word on the `Map.!: given key is not an element..` bug? Because at this point i'm about ready to bail out of this language, which is really painful for me to say. I've invested a lot of time in it and I think its almost perfect, but it has been a relatively long time since 0.19 was released, and no matter how many times I try and get an answer, noone knows. Its a game breaking bug and noone seems to acknowledge its existence..

It goes against everything this language seems to stand for, friendliness to newcomers, helpful error messages. Its just a plain blocker to anyone new who uses the language.

It feels to me at this point, as someone who has been coding Elm extensively for the last few years, that noone seems to care anymore. I understand the lack of communication when developing a new feature set, but this is a bug, is there any reason why a bug in the compiler has sat unfixed for so long? And if so, why won't anyone tell the community? I'm very fed up with it, and I've actually been scared to write this message because I know I'll likely get a massive backlash, but when the github issue was locked and limited in November, what am I supposed to do? To me it isn't really the bug anymore, but the lack of communication over it. It feels like a big F you to the community that love the language, and a big F you to the newcomers who are sold by the amazing ideas that Elm gets so right, only to be confronted by a really unfriendly and unsolvable Haskell bug in the compiler when they use, for example, the elm style animation library (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation/latest/Animation>).. which is something newcomers probably want to do quite often."
297,1548891229.5148,Virgie,"It has been quiet, some news would be welcome. In any case, without the `--debug` flag you should be fine. Also, in any case even if that bug were fixed today, there might be other things that maybe also need to be done before a 0.19.1 release can happen. Releases don't happen often by design; also I'd hope that `Map.!` won't be used in the compiler going forward. it shows exactly why elm's non-crashing is so nice"
297,1548891284.5163,Jenice,"If the bug has been fixed, why wait to release 0.19.1? Isn't that the reason we're using semantic versioning?"
297,1548891405.5184,Virgie,there is more. There are some problems with adding packages/version conflicts. Releases bundle a bunch of work because there is (a lot) of overhead to a release. Also I'm really not sure how much work it is to fix this bug (we know the cause).
297,1548891441.5191,Jenice,"Okay, so given that, would it not be sensible to tell the community?"
297,1548891462.5197,Ruthann,is the only workaround to remove the `--debug` flag? i haven’t encountered it myself; ah… that’s because i don’t use the `--debug` flag :stuck_out_tongue:
297,1548891498.5207,Jenice,Yes
297,1548891507.521,Virgie,"yes, just for full context the problem occurs when exposing a type alias for an internal (non-exposed) type; something that many packages do, so this is a real problem in pretty much any elm app"
297,1548891561.5226,Jenice,"I'm not the most experienced developer, and i'm not as talented as probably yourself or Evan, but this bug must have turned off hundreds of people off of Elm; Not everyone will come to this slack and even find the non `--debug` flag solution"
297,1548891653.5248,Ruthann,"eddy, can you continue without the --debug flag?"
297,1548891663.5252,Jenice,No; On multiple projects; Do you mean continue development?
297,1548891696.5267,Ruthann,"yeah, typically i use Debug.log; my state is so huge that having --debug on lags my app to unusability; so i haven’t been using that flag for the last 2 yrs"
297,1548891729.5286,Jenice,"I can muddle through without --debug yes, but I don't think that is the point i'm really trying to make here"
297,1548891749.5293,Virgie,I would think those people would never even find the `--debug` flag. In any case: yes it is frustrating but I don't see a clear way forward that would be obviously better.
297,1548891760.5296,Jenice,"By default people are going to come to this language and turn on the `--debug` flag; I'd prefer they even rip out the `--debug` option at this point. If I was a newcomer to Elm and I hit that Haskell bug, I think i would just stop and look for something else"
297,1548891883.5317,Virgie,"well, the whole debugger is somewhat flawed in its current form, and needs serious rethinking to be really practical.; it's great for finding the order in which messages happen for instance, but I don't think the whole ""saving a session"" thing has delivered so far. A big technical question is when to invalidate (change in model, change in Msg)."
297,1548891991.535,Jenice,I mean it’s enabled by default with create-elm-app..; Aren’t we arguing about the wrong thing here? The worthiness of the bug seems almost irrelevant
297,1548892055.5372,Virgie,what is the right thing to argue about?
297,1548892083.5382,Jenice,The lack of communication regarding if/when it will be fixed
297,1548892189.5416,Ruthann,"i can hear the frustration in your voice and yeah it sucks to be where you’re at there. i’m not here to vouch for elm or for the core team’s communication of bugs, though personally i think they try their best.
if you can keep going without it then do so, elm has been a very practical and productive language for me.
if you can’t then you have to make the call here.

the way that I’ve worked is to find an acceptable workaround and keep going, i lead a team of 3 on a mid (60k loc) legacy rewrite and frankly i’m scared of what happens when this project ends and i have to go back to js…

if you think this needs to be better communicated, then be the person to better communicate it :slightly_smiling_face:"
297,1548892263.5428,Virgie,"right. understanding that requires that you follow elm-related discourse quite well I think: that communication has not worked out well in the past. It is just not productive for Evan to say ""bug is hard, I'm working on it"", and even less productive for him to spell out the details."
297,1548892424.547,Jenice,"I just don’t subscribe to that, It seems very easy for somebody on core to acknowledge bug is hard, We’re working on it. Anyone in this slack knows people come here daily reporting this bug again and again. If that many come to slack reporting it, imagine how many don’t come to the slack, and just abandon ship. I honestly have no way to know that they are working on it? No acknowledgement from anybody for months at this point; It’s not a language paradigm up for debate, I understand the arguments Evan makes in that regard, I just want to know if I can ever use the debugger again"
297,1548892874.5522,Virgie,"I hear that. I remember when Evan would post regular updates on the elm-dev mailing list (which were always fun to read), but also saw how the discussion around it didn't really work out.

Can we ever use the debugger again? probably, but who knows in what form. I sketched some of the issues with the debugger earlier, and maybe they're working on a larger rehaul of the system. In the spirit of ""better do it right than right now"".  We'd know if elm were abandoned (it isn't), so there will be something eventually"
297,1548892927.5524,Jenice,It's just not enough for me I think
297,1548893037.5541,Virgie,"I'm just trying to clarify the situation. There are underlying reasons for the current state of affairs. I would like an official statement on it, but (given the past) understand why that may be difficult."
297,1548893302.5558,Ruthann,"&gt; but also saw how the discussion around it didn't really work out.

yeah, evan gets a lot of negativity and demands whenever he posts so he stopped posting. i also liked the little progress updates and insights into what he was working on next."
297,1548893900.5601,Cornell,"And also a lot of discussions that go all over the place.  Updates would be nice, though personally I’ve invested a lot in Elm because I have a lot of faith in Evan as a designer.  For me, an aspect of having faith in Evan as a designer is to have trust that he is managing himself and the technical direction of the project well.  He’s done it this far, and in my opinion has done exceedingly well.

So, I direct my energies elsewhere from putting requirements on him."
297,1548893978.561,Jenice,"I hear that, but to me this isn't a design task, it's a bug in the design that i've already bought in to; I'm sold on Elm; Is there noone else in a core-ish capacity that could update the Elm community that a major bug was being worked on?"
297,1548894253.5652,Nana,"I think I read a post somewhere saying they were totally reworking the debugger, so perhaps they're just ignoring the bug in favor of the new debugger :thinking_face:"
297,1548894317.5674,Jenice,If someone on core had told me what you just said ^ then I would feel quite a bit better
297,1548894331.5678,Lashawnda,We know about all of the bugs that have been brought up and they’re all being fixed. Some are already fixed but someone already brought up about batching releases so I won’t repeat 
297,1548894371.5681,Alison,"hey, thanks for ellie btw :heart:"
297,1548894443.5705,Jenice,"Thanks Luke, thats really the first time i've heard in the last few months that they're being fixed and I appreciate the update"
297,1548894451.5708,Lashawnda,You’re welcome! It’s being transitioned to a new maintainer and I’m looking forward to the new perspective he’ll bring
297,1548894476.5714,Jenice,Could you maybe clarify the batching bit?
297,1548894481.5715,Alison,Good on ya for that outlook. Looking forward to it
297,1548894538.5736,Lashawnda,"There are a lot of secondary effects to doing a release that need to be managed for it to go well, so Evan tries to group stuff together in a cohesive way and release it all at once so that it’s nicer to communicate what has changed"
297,1548894609.5748,Nana,"ah, found the post I was talking about, although I don't know if it's still relevant : <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor>
&gt; Since then (1) the internal implementation of Elm has changed a decent amount and (2) we have learned a lot about what production users need to use this tool seriously. So time travel is not available in elm-reactor right now, but it will be coming back with a new design focused on real workflows."
297,1548894625.5752,Lashawnda,"Basically, each release has a clearly stated goal"
297,1548894632.5754,Nana,"that sounds to me like a new debugger?; and the readme was last edited by Evan, August 2018"
297,1548894702.577,Lashawnda,We’d like a more advanced debugger but I don’t think anyone is working on it. I was planning to but other stuff in life came up
297,1548894975.581,Dede,"Quoting from <https://www.deconstructconf.com/2017/evan-czaplicki-on-storytelling> :

“In my projects, I use a different approach, that I think is controversial. But it works well, in my opinion, which is that someone opens an issue, and we say, OK. And someone else opens another issue. And over time, we let these build up. And we do a more high level analysis of all of the concerns people have. And so when you look at them holistically, you can find one fix that addresses all those concerns in a way that’s clear.

“And I think this, in the end, leads to better design. But from the perspective of storytelling, it also means you have a stronger narrative. Each release is about-- we did this work on the compiler. Elm has an emphasis on developer experience. You get a broader narrative than 40 things happened…”"
297,1548894997.5822,Jenice,"I hear you about the stated goal of each release, but I don't see why a bugfix couldn't be released for the compiler if you have a fix? As I mentioned earlier I think the impact on newcomers to the language is probably pretty severe. There seems to be a potential fix here: <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C13L7S5GR/p1547537552048900>; Sure, but that doesn't really make sense with bug fixes surely?"
297,1548895239.5873,Lashawnda,The way that we approach fixing stuff isn’t to just fix the one issue and release a patch. We do more of a structural analysis on all of the problems and look for a solution that works at the level of category rather than individual issue. In this case the work that fixes the debug flag also fixes other stuff and makes a bunch of improvements beyond the specific problem.
297,1548895338.5897,Nana,"I haven't found the debugger particularily necessary so far anyway, so seems like an easy solution to just run without `--debug`; and I think people are pretty used to struggling with Webpack etc. so a buggy debugger shouldn't be that bad :stuck_out_tongue:"
297,1548895438.5936,Lashawnda,"Regarding the impact, I’m not sure that it actually is that widely used of a feature and it doesn’t feature too frequently in beginner educational materials that we’ve seen. My intuition is that the effects are pretty marginal. But if there’s evidence that isn’t the case we should consider it!"
297,1548895654.5971,Dede,I think in this philosophy that even bug fixes fall into this bucket — sometimes the way to fix a bug is not a point fix but a larger rearchitecting.
297,1548895731.5982,Jenice,"I personally think the debugger should be the showcase of the language and architecture, time-travelling debugging (especially with the pure guarentees that TEA provides) is what sold me on elm originally."
297,1548895764.5989,Nana,"I feel like the time traveling is more ""cool"" than actually ""useful"" though"
297,1548895790.5995,Jenice,I work a lot with websockets and I find it real useful
297,1548895846.602,Nana,"yeah I suppose in that case, or when making games, it could be pretty useful"
297,1548895860.6023,Jenice,"but regardless, I just think the communication levels could be improved, today I heard for the first time that the bug which hampered a lot of peoples development experience a lot was being worked on, which I appreciate."
297,1548895878.603,Lashawnda,"i actually agree with that sentiment which is why i was hoping to work on the debugger a lot more. the thing about it though is that the status quo debugger doesn't really accomplish that goal and it would be a long term project to do that. so in our calculus that doesn't justify treating the --debug flag bug as an emergency release; &gt; today I heard for the first time that the bug which hampered a lot of peoples development experience a lot was being worked on
this is just gonna happen to some folks from time to time. we actually communicate about this more frequently than some of us would personally care to, it's just that there are multiple forums, and they all have folds for content to fall behind, and we inevitably repeat stuff; this is not the first public conversation that i've had about the --debug flag, and it's definitely not first time i've responded to the suggestion of doing a bugfix release for something"
297,1548896240.6066,Jenice,"Again I'm sorry I just don't subscribe to that, why not just remove the debug flag for now?; I honestly think you should just remove the --debug flag for now"
297,1548896285.6078,Nana,that seems a bit extreme :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
297,1548896320.609,Jenice,It just feels like a really bad experience to have as a newcomer
297,1548896330.6095,Lashawnda,"but that also requires doing a bug fix release, which we have to implement, and then build and test on all the platforms, and then update all of the installers, and then write and distribute announcements"
297,1548896335.6098,Jenice,maybe a bit extreme :see_no_evil:
297,1548896348.6101,Lashawnda,it's like multiple days of stuff for several people at minimum
297,1548896415.6114,Jenice,I guess its a choice between the work or the people who hit the bug; I don't know enough about how the team structure work to comment really
297,1548896497.613,Lashawnda,"just to turn off a thing that people don't use very much in the first place and could proceed without, and then totally reverse some amount of time later when the bigger picture change is done"
297,1548896543.6132,Jenice,"Alright; I appreciate the chat anyway, it has helped clear things up a bit; I have got to go bed now really; I hope you see mainly my comments come from a love for the community and language"
297,1548896616.615,Lashawnda,"oh definitely, this was a good conversation!"
297,1548896633.6152,Jenice,cheers
297,1548896656.6157,Lashawnda,good night!
304,1548898005.617,Dede,I’m not the architect of the idea. But I think the notion is that even minor releases like that detract from the impact of the story of the major release.  
305,1548898344.6173,Earlean,The Elm guide is the best place to start; <https://guide.elm-lang.org/>; <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example> is one good example of a large Elm app.; <https://github.com/elm/package.elm-lang.org> is another good example that does some things differently
305,1548898721.6181,Alison,"Hi, jessta! Thanks. I read the guide a couple of years ago, and this is a great idea; I'll deffinitely check out those two projects. Thank you"
306,1548928512.6194,Selene,anyone with tips on how to create ios8601 date strings with timezone offset?
305,1548928711.6197,Earlean,You can fork <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-iso8601-date-strings/blob/1.1.2/src/Iso8601.elm#L405-L427>
307,1548934325.6212,Tyisha,what about a warning in the console about using `--debug` that links to one of the github issues/discourse posts?
306,1548936249.6217,Selene,"is there really no easy way to get the timezone offset with elm/time?; Zone is an opaque type, so i cant access its values; all i can use is `getZoneName` which gives me the zone name not the offset"
306,1548937283.6236,Bert,I guess a convoluted way to get there would be to use `toHour` and `toMinute` with both `utc` and the current time zone. :slightly_smiling_face:
306,1548937883.6242,Earlean,That seems like a reasonable way to do it since the offset is specific time dependent
306,1548938561.6246,Selene,"thx for the hint, i will try that"
306,1548938665.6254,Huong,"If you have a time, you can use <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/time-extra/latest/Time-Extra#toOffset> to calculate the offset for a given timezone at a certain point in time; Which probably does what <@Bert> suggested under the hood :smile:"
306,1548938884.6264,Selene,this is exactly what i need. :raised_hands:
306,1548939120.6269,Olevia,"if you compile in debug mode , does elm use Html.keyed for optimization or is that disabled?"
306,1548939249.6288,Earlean,"<@Olevia> `--debug` doesn't change the way your app works, it just enabled the debugger"
306,1548939291.6296,Olevia,uh sorry i meant DEV mode; the one where you get the message in the console saying so
306,1548939311.6307,Earlean,You shouldn't see any difference between compiling with `--optimize` and without it.; Are you seeing something different?
306,1548939445.6339,Olevia,"Just figuring out our options, we have  a pretty substantial grid and it feels sluggish; And I'm using elm-ui so im pretty sure ever el is keyed by default; so i was wondering if it wasnt enabled or something; or rather, every el in col and row is keyed"
306,1548939613.6381,Shenita,"`Html.keyed` is mainly there to optimise when you have a list of items, and items might get inserted or removed or moved around; so if you insert an item at the top of a list, elm knows not to just modify the existing node at the top of the list, but instead to create a brand new node for that first item and then to reuse the existing node for the second item; if that makes sense?; so making every node keyed is generally not ideal, only when you have dynamic lists of things"
306,1548939874.643,Olevia,"nah i get it, i just thought they did it on every element by default; but looking at the docs i can see they have that in a seperate module"
306,1548939886.6437,Shenita,ah right fair
306,1548939892.6439,Olevia,so im gonna go and key some stuff and hope it boosts performance

308,1548941839.6455,Antonette,"Hey everybody ; I've had that crazy notion of adding `Traversal`s and maybe `Fold`s to `Monocle` for quite some time already, but even though I have a rough idea of what they are and why I'd use them, I'm a bit uncertain on how to implement them ""the right way"" and can't seem to find any decent beginner-friendly explanation on the web.

I think it would be helpful to standardize the process"
309,1548946434.6582,Cammy,"In fairness, this is my fifth attempt in a year at that api. It’s an extreme uphill battle to perfect and get it accepted. I honestly don’t know if I would subject myself to it again. 

There have been others, too, canvas is the one I remember most vividly. "
309,1548946465.6585,Dayna,That doesn't sound... great.

309,1548946694.664,Cammy,"It’s tough. For one thing my timing was bad. My first proposal was a few weeks before the announcement of the no native policy. And I had no idea what the process would look like...and I’m not sure anyone else did either. 

I honestly think the discussion of ports will always remain (people who are learning want to push boundaries), but grow much smaller in volume as the platform expands. 

But I am frustrated at the lack of progress. All of the work is falling on Evan’s shoulders, and he’s doing an incredible job, but he’s just one man. I think it’s a situational challenge that needs to be figured out. 

I’m trying to do my part, and media api is my domain. But it’s been really hard."
311,1548947641.6646,Dayna,Thanks for taking your time to respond.
312,1548949446.665,Dede,Elm's definitely on the curve described here: <https://krausefx.com/blog/scaling-open-source-communities>  There are natural tensions that are not easily resolved.
313,1548950897.6652,Teddy,Hey <@Alison> long time no see :wave:
313,1548952047.6658,Claretta,"I think it's ok that there are not a lot of Browser API suggestions. Building nice APIs is really much much harder than it seems.  The `viewport` APIs in 0.19 are a really nice example of this IMO.  It's a wonderful API that my team recently used in working with tooltips that made the process far easier than it's ever been in JS, but my understanding is that it took many revisions and failed attempts to get to what we have now.; I'm also hoping that more collaboration on building nice APIs with ports can help inform the process of planning native APIs"
313,1548952120.6665,Alison,"Hiya, Justin! Indeed"
314,1548953560.6727,Cammy,"I’m not sure the process needs to be standardized at the current scale. There was an attempt previously to do a committee and apparently it wound up very bureaucratic and unpleasant for all involved. 

Of course, processes are really hard and often need to change. Personally I think it’s something that could use improvement, either in how it works or at least how that’s communicated (but probably both). 

There’s definitely an advantage to going to meetups and being able to talk through it with  people in public, but that’s also a really big disadvantage to people who don’t live in big cities or near a person well-known and trusted in the community. "

319,1548980897.6864,Ruthann,"Modeling state and module imports after one’s app UI seems to be a fairly intuitive thing to do, but it’s the biggest mistake one can make in a elm app as it grows.

It then leads to problems like:
how to do parent child communication
  - exposing global Msgs
  - exposing type aliases and reaching into children state
how to pass state between routes
  - duplicate state
  - exposing internal states

I’ve observed this tendency in my predecessor’s code, my own code (after I refactored their code) and in others on my team.

I’m starting to think this is a big problem."
319,1548983829.6885,Earnest,"<@Ruthann> If a child needs to communicate with an abstraction boundary beyond it's scope, I'll have it return a `Maybe OutMsg` type that the main update can case match against and make the given adjustments. For duplicate states, I'll keep anything re-usable between views in the top-level module and pass them to my views/updates as arguments, instead of keeping them in the subpage's model.; Hiding the internals is only necessary if you need to ensure some variant holds for all potential values/transformations of the type."
319,1548986938.6911,Euna,"<@Ruthann> I feel the same way, and have started using the the outMsg with a defined structure"
318,1548986948.6914,Euna,works fairly well and doesnt add too much boilerplate
319,1548988286.6943,Ruthann,"&gt; If a child needs to communicate with an abstraction boundary beyond it’s scope,

then something like OutMsg is good, we have our own way of handing that which we call `Job a` that contains global msgs. Since we still have some 3+ level nesting, OutMsgs would have to repeat themselves on the way up to a distant cousin making it impractical.

However, I’m talking more about the process of thinking which ends up needing a OutMsg. Time and time again, I catch myself modelling close to or being affect by the UI when thinking about state.; Or modules rather… I prolly need to write this out, pretty vague atm.; It’s almost as if, there is just the ( init, update, Msg, type alias ) in one module and that is completely independent of UI or should be.
Then there is the ( view ) all by itself which is happily nested like the UI.; And I’m finding it hard to separate the two."

320,1549020294.7052,Karma,"The reason for starting it later is that I need to have the token to open the web socket. If I start it before I have the token, it's just retrying it without the token and failing every time; Unless there's a way to refresh the value or restart the subscription or something"
320,1549020358.7066,Nana,"if you only turn it on once, but never turn it off, it might be fine though"
320,1549020441.7084,Karma,So far I've only tried having the subscription in `subscriptions` and nowhere else
320,1549020527.7096,Lynne,"<@Karma> Try doing it as <@Nana> suggested: start from returning `Sub.none` and when you have your token in model return actual websocket subscription. If you see that messages from websocket are not coming, you can replace your `Sub.none` with something like `Time.every 1000000 (always NoOp)` which will hardly fire before you get your token :slightly_smiling_face:; Also, since you are using websockets I assume you are on Elm 0.18, is that correct?"
320,1549020555.7106,Karma,Yep!
320,1549020564.7109,Lynne,"Then, there should not be any problem; I am not aware of any problem with subscriptions in 0.18"

344,1549220905.8193,Nana,<@Ashton> it also says `view : Model -&gt; Html Model`
346,1549220978.8202,Nana,which I guess would actually work together with `update : Model -&gt; Model` :stuck_out_tongue:
344,1549221474.8225,Ashton,"Huh, yeah. I recall some funny type signature stuff leading to some confusing error messages before. One time we had a confusing error message, because none of us could see that for `f : a -&gt; b`, one possible value for `b` is `c -&gt; d -&gt; e -&gt; f`, which means that `a -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; e -&gt; f` is a kind of `a -&gt; b`."
344,1549221712.8237,Nana,"tried making an app with `view : Model -&gt; Html Model` :stuck_out_tongue:
<https://ellie-app.com/4D8KssZknm9a1>; turned out update became `update : Model -&gt; Model -&gt; Model` though"
347,1549225490.8248,Desire,"so I guess we missed us, I at least talked to a follow elm user at one point"
344,1549230145.8264,Garnet,Hrm. I used ```elm install elm-community/list-extra``` and it installed. Now I'm trying to install ```elm-lang/lazy``` and it goes; None
344,1549230245.8271,Virgie,"note the version, it' s 2.0.0, but list-extra is at 8.1.0 (maybe higher); I think you can fix it by putting the correct (latest) version in your elm.json"
344,1549230282.8278,Garnet,"It is, amusingly; None; elm-lang/lazy is at 2.0.0 though; Guess lazy won't work anymore then"
344,1549230490.8289,Virgie,"ow, right it doesn' t; at least, in 0.19"
344,1549230542.8301,Garnet,Is HamT array still a thing?
344,1549230552.8303,Virgie,"it was removed basically for simplicity; you can often use thunks (so `\_ -&gt; loadsOfWork` ) to prevent expensive computations when they are not used; HAMT is now the core `Array`; the other thing that lazy did was memoization (so, requesting an answer twice would only compute it once, then store it) and that is not possible implicitly any more"
344,1549230618.8316,Garnet,"Hm, shame ^^; And okay, benchmark still a thing? The git repo seems to suggest it's only 0.18"
344,1549230647.8323,Virgie,it moved to `elm-explorations/benchmark`
344,1549230666.8325,Garnet,Ah ^^ Thanks
344,1549230813.8336,Nana,<@Virgie> oh so Elm used to have built-in memoization? :open_mouth: hope it will come back
344,1549230934.8355,Virgie,"it sounds useful, but using it well was/is hard. If I remember correctly the number of practical use cases wasn't that large and it required some js tricks to make it work. Taking into account future garbage collection it was deemed not useful enough"
344,1549230953.8356,Garnet,"Sorry for so many questions, but ""import Time"" fails? Says it's part of core though, so I'm confused."
344,1549230974.8359,Virgie,it's a separate package now
344,1549230982.8361,Garnet,Hm
344,1549230987.8363,Virgie,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/>; also the API has changed quite a bit
344,1549231029.837,Garnet,"I see, how would I get that info? <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/> seems to still list Time"
344,1549231092.8374,Virgie,"right, so `elm-lang` moved to`elm` , so it's `elm/core`  now"
344,1549231128.8376,Garnet,"Oh, I see; Hm, old native Canvas seemed a bit more powerful. Seems I might have to mod this a bit to draw individual pixels well; Or not sure how good making a single rect for each pixel would be"
344,1549231954.839,Virgie,I think there are canvas custom elements available too
344,1549231967.8392,Garnet,custom elements?
344,1549231997.8397,Virgie,"yea, in current browsers (last couple of years) you can create your own html tags/elements from JS; and these can be instantiated from elm, and given input via attributes; which the element (via some js) can turn into whatever"
344,1549232047.8411,Garnet,"Hm, well the normal Canvas in JS alraedy has pixel-setting functions, but seems elm doesn't expose those"
344,1549232057.8413,Ashton,Did you solve this? I think youre getting your error is because `elm-lang/lazy` is not upgraded to Elm 0.19
344,1549232106.8426,Virgie,"exactly, but rather than hacking the elm api, you can use a custom element and some JS to keep the image generation in pure elm, but the precise rendering logic (setting pixels etc) in JS. ""hacking"" the elm api to draw individual pixels will likely be awkward"
344,1549232107.8428,Garnet,I might just try with rects and see if its okay
344,1549232133.8434,Ashton,"Funny that you guys are talking about this, I just did a ports experiment for canvas: <https://github.com/Chadtech/elm-canvas-ports-experiment>; My project seems to work.

What would be a good way to do that?"
351,1549270631.8601,Nana,<@Hwa> `Browser.Navigation.replaceUrl` should do that for you

351,1549271434.8648,Hwa,"I wouldn’t know how. `replaceUrl` and `pushUrl` both cause the `onUrlChange` message set in `Browser.application`, and there’s only a `Url` attached to that.; I could save the Url to the model, and on url change check whether `.path` stays the same. That would catch any changes to the query parameters."
351,1549272543.8688,Simon,"Just because you have a new url doesn’t mean you have to have a new model, per Simons point.

356,1549354648.8889,Danika,"tl;dw for that video? I’ve seen its idiomatic to have basically one port in and one out, but that feels odd to me. "
356,1549354783.8892,Lynne,I think it was more about changing the mindset; I don't think it really matters if you have one port for incoming and one port for outgoing data. Depending on your requirements you can have plenty of them. What's more important is to stop treating JS part as if it is an HTTP backend; That's my conclusion at least :slightly_smiling_face:; But since most of the time I am sending values to JS and get values from JS having different ports is just a way to tag messages. Which can also be done with type at Elm side and strings at JS side
356,1549355070.8927,Earlean,"<@Danika> really it's ""one port for each thing you want to communicate with""; imagine you have a server and you've got 10 connections to it and you're sending messages to it over those 10 connections, it's going to be hard to send those messages in any kind of order; with 1 connection you can send a batch of messages and then wait for a reply"
356,1549355260.896,Danika,Ah yes that’s reassuring 
356,1549355262.8961,Earlean,"but if you have 20 servers you need to have 20 connections and you're generally not going to expect to be able to maintain an order in the messaging between all 20 servers; The way Elm ports are designed is the 'actor model', it's what Erlang does.; it's asynchronous communication between multiple processes."
357,1549380365.9005,Saran,"how far are mutually recursive values/functions banned in 0.19? I have values wrapped in `\() -&gt; ...` lambdas, but that doesn't seem to help"
357,1549380478.9013,Virgie,"the obvious case `x = x` is always banned, and more intricate cases are only allowed in top-level definitions; so inside let-bindings there are further checks"
357,1549380656.9019,Saran,"`Elm will allow recursive definitions as long as there is at least one lambda before you get back to yourself.` but I have that; like, `let a = (\() -&gt; b); b = (\() -&gt; a) in a` is banned?"
357,1549380707.903,Teddy,"iirc, there are some exceptions to that rule with `let` nesting.; I don't remember why, I just know I've seen it happen."
357,1549380733.9039,Dede,When I was playing with this awhile back it seemed inconsistent.  I suspect the compiler is not entirely consistent on this yet.
357,1549380765.9042,Saran,"switching it over to `a () = b` works; but only if both are of that form, if either is a lambda, it fails"
357,1549381333.9066,Virgie,"the underlying reason is future garbage collection. top-level recursion is fine because these definitions are allocated once and are kept around, but when recursive definitions are defined in let-blocks then they have to be garbage-collected when the function returns. it is hard to correctly free a recursive definition"
357,1549381502.9069,Saran,what are my options then? y combinator?; giving up?; :confused:
357,1549381543.9076,Danika,Why would you need this?
357,1549381658.9084,Saran,"I'm building an interpreter, so I need the environment to contain a reference to the function I'm executing, so I can call it recursively"
357,1549381750.9088,Teddy,I'd go the y combinator route myself.
357,1549381775.9093,Saran,how would you express mutual recursion in terms of the y combinator in elm?

357,1549385862.9167,Saran,"cool, what kind of type system are you going to use?"
357,1549386173.9174,Danika,weak/implicit/dynamic. You typically don’t want to be worrying about types as a musician or performer

Re-exposing imports is supported in some languages, but Elm has chosen not to add that. I don't know if there's a fundamental reason.

Although, perhaps, there is one case where this could get mightily confusing:

let's say I have package X, where I define `type Foo = Foo | Bar`

I now create package Y, where I ""reexpose"" that `type Foo`.

Now, I publish a new major version of package X, with `type Foo = Foo | Bar | Baz`.

For the sake of argument, let's say I have `""package-x"": ""1.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 3.0.0""` in package Y: Now the values exposed by package Y depend on the version of package X you happen to have installed. I'm not sure how that should even show up on the package website :smile:; so, you can only expose an alias, which says nothing about the implementation details of what happens in some other module or even package"

369,1549475981.9879,Myung,"When I use `Url.Builder.custom` to make the url, `custom Relative [] [] (Just ""foo bar"")` it automatically encodes the component `/#foo%20bar`; <@Bert> ooo checking it out, thanks; interesting, it says to use Url.Parser instead in the docs; i think Url.Parser.fragment should decode by default… this is maybe an oversight?; the query parameter decoders automatically do it"
369,1549476087.9918,Bert,"I noticed the same thing with my app a little while ago, and Evan is looking for evidence at this point. So if you know a popular framework that automatically does URI decoding for fragments, feel free to respond in this thread. "
369,1549476121.9921,Myung,"i don’t use other frameworks; i think the behavior should be consistent though; 1) Url.Builder automatically encodes the fragment, so 2) I would expect Url.Parser to automatically decode as well"

369,1549485804.0104,Myung,haha yeah
369,1549485910.011,Dorsey,The only example where multiple segments are captured is for `map`. Maybe that's the key.

373,1549495751.026,Kimiko,Is there a way to figure out why `elm install elm/http` wants to install 1.0.0 if 2.0.0 is the latest?
373,1549495796.0262,Ruthann,check your elm.json?
373,1549495998.0268,Kimiko,"What do I check for, exactly? `elm/http` isn't mentioned explicitly in it"
373,1549496068.0278,Dorsey,<@Kimiko> it's probably because of other packages depending on `1.0.0`. Try removing and installing everything again.; E.g. you may have older version of `elm/core` and it depends on `http 1.0.0`.
373,1549496201.0294,Kimiko,"Ah, yes, I guess it was `elm/core` pinning the dependency. Thanks. And I guess from your reply there's no automatic way to find which package is responsible, I just have to bisect my dependencies or something?"
373,1549496383.0302,Dorsey,"I don't think there is. Dependency management needs some more love, I guess :wink:"

Couldn’t find an issue on elm/compiler about it; nuking elm-stuff works, wonder if this is a known/tracked issue; i take that back, mentioned here: <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1853#issuecomment-440618037>"

However, I realized I could get away with a single message that packs a closure, `UpdateInput (String -&gt; Model -&gt; Model) String`.  The closure then gets defined right at the relevant input, instead of over in the update function.  Are there reasons this might be a bad idea?; Snippet:
```type alias Model =

378,1549532857.0469,Karissa,"I guess these type aliases are not meant to be used to define values, but rather to constraint function signatures."
379,1549532895.0471,Karissa,At least that's the only use of extensible record I know of.
378,1549533001.0473,Liza,<https://github.com/justgook/platformer/blob/revision3/lib/elm-tiled/src/Tiled/Object.elm#L22-L28> - here is example - on how i moved away from  `extensible record` to custom types
378,1549533017.0475,Danika,It seems like a hacky use to get some sort of typeclass functionality to work. I think you're better off avoiding extensible records unless you have a really obvious usecase for them; ^ You can generally just make your own type that covers all your use cases if you think about it hard enough
378,1549533148.048,Liza,"&gt;I wonder how useful/necessary they (extensible records) are in practice

<https://github.com/justgook/platformer/blob/revision3/lib/elm-tiled/src/Tiled/Tileset.elm#L455> - btw - here is example on real-live usage of them.. but maybe is point move to some custom type ..; and missing constructor is other problem.. for creating such data - you need to write constructor by your self, and as 0.19 you cannot “inject” new fields to record - they become kind of pointless..; `merge: TilesDataPlain {}  -&gt; a -&gt; TilesDataPlain a` kind of not not possible today; 0.18 was - `merge {prop1,prop2} rest =  {rest | prop1 = prop1, prop2= prop2}`; now You must reconstruct that record fully, and as you don’t know structure of `a` you can’t do it any more..; extensible record:
0.18 - better not
0.19 - don’t - that is pain"
378,1549533832.0497,Corinne,"Also, I think i'm seeing that `NamedAndAged` isn't compatible with `Named`"
378,1549534075.05,Danika,"Are you doing this for any specific purpose, or just curiosity"
378,1549534490.0502,Tamra,"You can turn that `UpdateInput (String -&gt; Model -&gt; Model) String` into an `UpdateInput Model` easily:

```
view model =
    -- ...
    onInput (\full_name -&gt; UpdateInput { model | full_name = full_name })
    -- ...
```"
378,1549535072.0504,Corinne,It seemed very much like the right thing to do in order to abstract away from concrete types in an algorithm. Perhaps the same reason you'd code to interfaces in an OOP
378,1549535852.0507,Danika,"&gt; It seems like a hacky use to get some sort of typeclass functionality to work.

Elm doesn't work like Haskell or something. Its totally OK to have `Maybe.map` and `List.map` as completely separate functions, instead of have Maybe and List implement some Functor (in this example) typeclass like you would in Haskell.

Elm doesn't have this sort of ad hoc polymorphism (we were talking about this yesterday in <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> I think)."
380,1549546323.0518,Danika,I think this is an obvious answer. But assuming identical functionality do `browser.element .document .application` and `platform.worker` produce different sized bundles?
380,1549547523.0519,Huong,"Not really. `Platform` doesn't require `elm/browser` and `elm/html`, so you save out on a couple of dependencies and indirect dependencies. Even with function-level dead code elimination, I think `browser` bundles will still be a little larger"
381,1549549359.0524,Carman,"Using extensible records to model an inheritance hierarchy tends to be clunky in Elm.; There are a few other ways to get similar flexibility, depending on what your problem is"
382,1549549568.0528,Dede,<@Earlean> Thanks.  The reason I am playing with the closures is that it isolates the update logic closer to the use point; I don’t love the profusion of entries in `update` and `view` that come with lots of form elements.  The secondary tag style doesn’t really solve that.
381,1549549589.053,Carman,"1. Your problem might be able to be solved with a _regular custom type_, possibly with a type variable
2. You may want to _compose_ some custom types. This approach is nice because it allows you to nest just like the  extensible record but the `a` can be _anything_, not just a record.
3. You may want to _derive_ a common structure from disparate types"
382,1549549605.0532,Dede,"<@Tamra> Due to the asynchronous nature of updates, you can get in trouble closing over the model available to you at the time you click the button."
381,1549549682.0534,Carman,"Example of approach 2
```
type Named a = Named String a
type Aged a = Aged Int a

type alias NamedAndAged a = Named (Aged a)
```"
381,1549549745.0536,Liza,`type Aged a = Aged Int a` - you mean
381,1549549772.054,Carman,"good catch. fixed :+1:; An actual value might look like:
```
Named ""city hall"" (Aged 42 myBuilding)
```; This approach is very flexible and allows you to do some things with Elm's parametric polymorphism but can be annoying to unwrap, particularly when you're nesting deeply; I find it's most helpful when wrapping some extra context around a value; such as `Maybe User` or `Toggleable User`; You can see some more examples in this discourse thread: <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/extension-types/2762/3>; I wrote a bit about approach 3 (derive data) here: <https://thoughtbot.com/blog/gamedev-with-elm-types#composition-vs-inheritance>"
382,1549550947.0556,Earlean,"<@Dede> 'isolating the update logic' also couples it to the view, the general recommendation is for Msgs to describe events that happened and `update` handles what to do in response to that event. ; Eg. You may want to do something in addition to updating the model in response to input on a field"
382,1549551046.056,Dede,"In general I think that advice is sound.  It’s only in this specific case where “update text to equal text” is such a recurrent pattern that the signal/noise ratio started to feel too low to me.  But as you can tell by my putting out the question, I’m not super confident in the call :wink:"
381,1549551078.0562,Dede,"And yeah, i see what you mean about potentially wanting to do something more (autocomplete results fetch, etc.) than just update the text field on the model."
382,1549551249.0564,Earlean,"Doing `UpdateInput Email ""some@email""` allows you to move the 'noise' in to a function and put it in a module and not worry about it much."

I’m not a fan of inbound/outbound, because when I’m on the JS side I have to send stuff back through the “inbound,” which causes me some cognitive dissonance."
384,1549556272.0627,Randee,<@Cammy> small nit but `toElm` and `toJS`  might be better then?  `jsToElm` when you are already in JS and know where you are is redundant
384,1549556296.063,Cammy,That’s a good point. Still feel like we can name better.
384,1549556408.0636,Randee,hopefully you wrap the port communication in higher level functions/api and dont have to think about it too much
384,1549556709.064,Claretta,"This is similar to what I do, usually some version of `toFoo` and `fromFoo` I also tend to use separate pairs of ports for independent systems in JS.  So I might have `toStorage` and `fromStorage` or `toWebSocket` and `fromWebSocket`"
385,1549557735.0644,Agustin,I name them by what they do
384,1549559275.0651,Cammy,"Yeah, it works. I’m not totally satisfied with t tho. "
386,1549559502.0653,Huong,"Talking about some topic more with the express purpose of artificially drowning out regular conversation just so a channel will be created is definitely not what I'm recommending here. If we notice a bunch of people seem eager to discuss a topic, and we feel like it would be helpful to give them a specific space to discuss, then we're more than happy to give them a space. Good examples of this are <#C0RSQNQ92|graphql> and <#C4F9NBLR1|elm-ui> which have plenty of action.

I don't feel like there is enough discussion about purescript to warrant creating a channel for it and seeing it die within a few weeks. It seems to pop up every now and then, and that seems perfectly fine to me. Last but not least, we do prefer keeping (new) channels on this Slack to be about Elm.

The `filters` type has a bunch of properties like `inStock`, `bpaFree`, etc. Those filters are implemented by a type called `BooleanFilter`. Visually, it looks a bit like this:

```
model
    query
        filters
            inStock
            bpaFree
```

I omitted a bunch of other properties on the `model`, `query`, and `filters` types.

I have a lot of repeated code that handles toggling the filters. It looks something like this:

```
let

    filters =
        model.query.filters
in
filters.inStock

    |&gt; (\updatedFilters -&gt; { query | filters = updatedFilters })
    |&gt; (\updatedQuery -&gt; { model | query = updatedQuery })

403,1549669544.197,Virgie,I would not want to work with/maintain JS code generated by the elm compiler. The main issue (beside style) is that you'd need a really thorough understanding of the elm runtime (how/when commands are executed)
401,1549669659.199,Huong,"It would also make it essentially impossible to recompile the Elm code without losing manual changes, so once you start editing the compiled JS, you lose the ability to Elm. together with any and all advantages Elm offers. For what it's worth, I've noticed that people don't need a whole lot of time to get productive in Elm, especially when they have some prior programming experience."
401,1549669816.2005,Charity,<@Halina> - I suggest helping the team learn Elm. We've got a junior JS dev that learned Elm and they didn't have any problems.

413,1549800120.2291,Huong,Yep. It creates a callgraph from the entrypoint(s) of your application. Any function that does not appear in the callgraph is unused.

416,1549831372.2412,Maida,"There are all kinds of business needs where there is a need for something that people have seen somewhere else and already know how to use.

You can have reusable widgets on the simpler side like a dropdown and you can have complex widgets like a virtual table data editor.

Some of these widgets, like an autocomplete widget are surprisingly complex to implement. Using a readily made library where someone solved all the quirks saves a lot of time. Of course, using a poorly implemented library can waste a lot of time because one would have to deal with the problems introduced by the library.; Also, when people reach for “reusable widgets”, in some of the cases they are not actually looking for reusability but for abstraction. They want to abstract away some hairy piece of the UI in order to be able to think clearly about the rest of the UI."

I’m reusing the “card” data view, as well as re-using the subview.

And a reusable “undoable” text editor component.
I’m using a package I built <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/z5h/component-result/latest/> to make this all glue together rather well.
I’m not convinced we shouldn’t call an (init/update/view) tuple a component (and by component I mean the standard english definition of being a smaller part of a larger thing).
For me, this style hasn’t created any more problems than I’d expect with any other style."
418,1549834492.2437,Earlean,Why use the word 'component' when the word 'module' is already part of the Elm language?

429,1549898479.0403,Niesha,"I'd go with installing stack (from <http://stackage.org|stackage.org>), `stack init` and then `stack install`; might work just fine"
429,1549898511.0413,Sadie,Thanks
429,1549898513.0415,Niesha,There's currently a holy war going on between cabal (package manager) and stack (package set manager) in Haskell land :disappointed:
429,1549898551.042,Garnett,"Anyone had it successfully compile on macOS, and wouldn’t mind uploading the binaries?"
429,1549899031.0423,Earnestine,yeah... this is very helpful. I'm wondering why this is not published as a 18 package? Anything against me publishing these files as `elm-future19` or so?

429,1549899432.0428,Lynn,"those instructions worked a charm for me. It makes 0.19 possible for us now, but still a lot of code to migrate"

^ shouldn't this be valid?"
429,1549899598.044,Emilee,"ah, it's not a valid format apparently; but still, the error message seems weird"
430,1549899665.0449,Emilee,it seems the thing i'm trying to parse is not a date string but a `Date` value... is there any way I can decode that without converting it to a string on the js side?
430,1549899818.045,Earnestine,None
431,1549900493.0458,Niesha,"<@Garnett> <@Sadie> I remember someone having a stack.yaml flying around, I'll see if I can find it - with that, it should be a breeze"
429,1549900552.0459,Denae,"<@Garnett> You need to use the proper resolver for stack, the most recent one doesn't work. I think lts-11.20 should work <https://lisplog.org/building_the_elm_compiler.html>"

431,1549900957.0471,Carman,Hmmm I'm not sure I understand why that's necessary?
431,1549900970.0474,Nicolasa,Thanks. That is quite impressive. 
431,1549900999.0476,Carman,You have a string coming in through a port?
431,1549901119.0484,Huong,"date as a string (but not a json string) parsed through ports, I'm guessing"
429,1549901182.049,Huong,anyway
431,1549901200.0494,Huong,"that still looks equivalent to `dateDecoder = Decode.dateTime`; &gt; not a date string but a `Date` value...

Ah, should've read up"
431,1549901377.0505,Carman,hmmm I didn't realize date objects were valid `Value`s?
431,1549901396.0509,Huong,Anything is a valid `Value` if it's coming through a port
431,1549901481.0517,Carman,"I see. But it's unusable unless you stringify it, hence that `Encode.encode`?"
432,1549901723.0533,Candance,"Hey folks! I'm new to Elm, just installed it today. What do you think about <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> being blocked in Russia? It's some kind of blocker for new users. Of course we can all use VPNs and proxies but..."
431,1549901779.0538,Agustin,Theres not a lot that can be done about it I believe; Its due to the blocking of a large part of AWS in order to disable telegram; AFAIK; I may be misinformed
431,1549902063.0578,Candance,"I see two ways of solving this issue:
1. Move to non-blocked IP inside of Amazon/DigitalOcean/whatever. Lot's of IP is still available and they (government) unblocked 20 millions of Amazon IPs recently.
2. Build local mirrors for such ""problematic"" regions as Russia, China, Iran, etc; By the way, Telegram is still working fine :slightly_smiling_face:"
431,1549902124.0589,Agustin,"The attempt to block Telegram then :stuck_out_tongue:; 1. Is difficult, as it relies on trial and error to get an ip that isn’t blocked
2. Requires some one to volunteer to do so; Everyone agrees it’s sub optimal :confused:"
431,1549902201.0605,Candance,"Is there a way to ""plug-n-play"" a mirror or we need to develop a solution?"
431,1549902270.0615,Agustin,I think you’d need some way to indicate the dns
431,1549902296.0618,Candance,"Also list of mirrors should be built in elm binary, and then it should select one with minimal ping; I believe Debian works like this"
431,1549902319.0625,Agustin,"Yes I think you’d have to do something like that; Another problem is Elm is basically a one person project, so we are limited by Evans bandwidth; In short, vpn is easier :slightly_smiling_face:"
431,1549902478.0642,Candance,"What do you mean? Indicate dns?; I can resolve <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> to 159.89.227.162, even can ping it, but can't `curl` it or open with browser"
431,1549902619.0647,Agustin,What you then elaborate on later; You need someway for elm to know where the packages are
431,1549902777.0651,Emilee,yep^^' at least i'm not sure how else i could parse it. I'm just thankful the `toString` of `Date` seems safe
431,1549902845.0658,Candance,Isn't it an opensource project? I believe we are all welcome to contribute :slightly_smiling_face:
431,1549903006.0663,Carman,It sounds like it might be better to stringify on the JS side of things? Then you have control over how the date gets serialized instead of hoping `Encode.encode` does the right thing for a JS date object.
431,1549903017.0667,Desire,"yes, still there are multiple ways to contribute; I feel like evan has too many other repos that are not the compiler, like the packages website under only his hand"
431,1549903131.068,Agustin,BDFL
431,1549903150.0681,Emilee,"the problem there is that this date is deep within a data structure we use as redux state. i'm trying to build a parser that can take the verbatim redux state and convert it to a strongly typed elm record, so we can slowly switch our application state to elm"
431,1549903202.0689,Desire,not sure if that is really what BDFL is about
431,1549903233.0691,Candance,"Benevolent Dictator For Life; like Guido in Python; by the way why all of the stuff is built with Haskell? I feel that it would be much simpler with Python, at least packages website; (I'm from procedural or OOP world)"
431,1549903483.0725,Nana,"<@Candance> well, since Elm is a ML-family language, and the compiler is written in Haskell, it makes sense that other stuff is written in those languages as well (plus that's what Evan knows I guess)"
431,1549903506.0731,Danika,simple is subjective
433,1549903750.0744,Saran,"Hey everyone, how often do you all add fields to records? Like, use the `{ myRecord | newField = 42 }` syntax? I haven't needed to use that in a long time, but I'm aware that I'm not using elm like most elm devs do."
433,1549903845.0751,Danika,"You mean adding a new field?; Doesn't seem like something you'd want to do very often unless you were leaning into extensible records a lot, which isn't common"
433,1549903900.0758,Saran,"yeah, adding a new field"
431,1549903907.0763,Nana,hmm I thought that wasn't allowed anymore
433,1549903974.0777,Saran,"I'd expect it to be used heavily for the model? That most apps use a huge flat record as its state, and that people update fields using record update syntax, but not that people add fields dynamically"
433,1549903986.0779,Danika,"I've never tried it / needed to, but it does seem like something not very elm-like.; This seems *horrible* to be doing to your model. Every update your models type would change :')"
431,1549904025.0788,Saran,"fair enough, it doesn't seem to be supported in 0.19 anymore ""The `a` record does not have a `y` field:"""
433,1549904047.0793,Saran,"eh, we've got type variables, right? :wink:"
433,1549904063.0802,Agustin,"You can change them, but not add them I believe"
433,1549904069.0806,Saran,"ok, nobody's using it, and I didn't notice for 8 months that support for them was removed; cool"
433,1549904071.0809,Nana,"<@Saran> yeah you can update records, and you can use extensible records for type signatures, but you can't add fields like that"
433,1549904071.081,Danika,"Seems like if it was ever allowed, that it was just a consequence of how it handled record updating"
433,1549904126.0818,Nana,"I think it used to be possible, but no one used it, and it would make future garbage collection much harder, so it was removed"
433,1549904254.0822,Emilee,"uuuuuh... what?
```
This argument is an anonymous function of type:

    Skin -&gt; Element.Element msg

But `Element` needs the 1st argument to be:

    #Skin# -&gt; Element.Element msg
```; oh, i get what's wrong. but the compiler message still makes no sense"
433,1549904643.0829,Danika,what was the problem?
433,1549904837.0845,Agustin,Input translation output rotation
433,1549904866.085,Denae,"The feature to add/remove fields to records was in Elm until 0.17 I believe. The reasoning for removing them as far as I remember was that it added quite a bit of complexity to the type checker and the implementation relied on JS prototype chains, the usage apparently wasn't very high so they opted to remove it.; ~&gt; <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/985>"
433,1549905423.0862,Saran,"whoa, so I haven't used it since 0.17 then?"
433,1549905433.0866,Emilee,Elm actually wanted the whole upper signature to be `Skin`
431,1549905451.0871,Emilee,"Which is to say, I forgot an argument "
434,1549909322.0879,Teddy,Welcome back and wooooo!

431,1549912041.0911,Hoyt,"Working on an episode (probably a two-parter) on polymorphic custom attributes in rails, following some of the episodes on whole values."
431,1549912081.0918,Earnestine,"i think `elm reactor` is a nice tool. However, once you need to add a port to your elm file, it's pretty much much useless, right?

438,1549926149.0985,Bernardina,"Is it possible to import CSS file into Elm code, or somehow instruct a compiler to include it in the generated `index.html`?"
438,1549926501.0986,Van,"You can use `Browser.element` as app root, build `js` bundle by your own and write down html file where you can include whatever you need"
438,1549927921.0988,Desire,not limited to Browser.element btw
438,1549928011.0995,Bernardina,Is `elm reactor` suitable for production - i.e. can it be used to serve files in production?; Or should I use some other HTML server
438,1549928425.1014,Alleen,"personally I would dump it to an html file and serve it via nginx, but if you’re okay with exposing the Reactor UI to anyone visiting your site, go right ahead."

439,1549932738.1061,Earlean,<@Danika> perhaps <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/json-extra/latest/Json-Decode-Extra#collection> will work.
440,1549932883.1066,Danika,Hmm; Maps aren’t array-like unfortunately; I think I’m SOL/; It wouldn’t be a problem but I’m dealing with some quite complex data structures that I don’t have much control over. I can call `toArray` on all necessary items directly but it’s going to make the js quite messy. Bummer ^^
441,1549949526.1094,Bert,"Markdown doesn't really specify how relative URLs should be handled. I've seen this happen on some other git sites besides GitHub, too. ; How do you get a Map through to Elm land though? Ports with Json.Decode.Value?"

443,1549957929.1116,Lynne,My implementation is not packaged and it is not better than norpan's package. It is just a direct implementation via event handlers which I did when I did not know that package existed.

448,1549982559.1484,Sadie,I have a elm SPA app (built from elm-kitchen) and I have a question regarding the routing : <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Route.elm#L32>; I have a list of things that I can filter / #faceting); I am considering adding this facets selection into the URL
449,1549982619.15,Sadie,So that people can save or share them
448,1549982654.1504,Sadie,Does anyone already did something like that with the Url Parser?
448,1549982753.1512,Earlean,"<@Sadie> the `#` part of the url is called the 'fragment', <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/url/latest/Url-Parser#fragment>"
448,1549982801.1523,Sadie,"Yes I know, I am a bit reluctant to add a querystring inside the fragment; I am also reluctant to add null values in the URL"
449,1549982854.1538,Dorthey,I’m trying to figure out a nice way to tween between values. As an example: I have a view that displays a dollar amount “$1234” and when I get an update to that value I want to animate between the old value and the new value.
448,1549982873.1542,Sadie,:confused: `#/things/filterStatus=open/filterOP=True/`
448,1549982917.1544,Velia,What's wrong with queries? Maybe you could use something like `https://...?filter=foo+bar+whatever`?
448,1549982961.1546,Bert,"How do you imagine the animation happening? ; Just to make sure: this is a major feature for the app, yes? "
448,1549983093.1551,Dorthey,I’m imagining it would work something like `mdgriffith/elm-style-animation` but instead of animating a style I can animate a generic property on my model that I can display in my view.; <https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation>; And yes – unfortunately this is a major feature for the app. :slightly_smiling_face:
448,1549983207.1557,Sadie,I am trying to see if we could do that with elm-animation and some css; Something like that <https://css-tricks.com/animating-the-content-property/#article-header-id-1>

448,1549983291.1573,Emilee,"hmm, i'm running into an unexpected type error

448,1549983302.1576,Bert,"I guess it depends on what the animation should look like. I am imagining a scrolling flip number thing, which is probably very hard to do no matter the tech"

448,1549983418.16,Emilee,`decorative` isn't bound anywhere

448,1549983787.1676,Emilee,"huh, apparently recompiling often enough fixed it?"
448,1549983811.168,Sadie,You mean using the fragment for page routing and the querystring for filters?
448,1549983812.1682,Antonette,That's suspicious... maybe you hadn't saved your file on the previous compile?
448,1549983824.1684,Emilee,pretty sure i did; but you never know; at least it works now. if that hadn't worked it would've thrown my whole project overboard pretty much; and would have had me question a lot of things

455,1549993179.1884,Florencia,"ah I think I know where my error is. I was trying to read the scrollHeight thing from the `input` event itself, but in the jQuery example you're reading it from the element; dang JS :smile:"

455,1549993593.1916,Lupita,"oh, that is getting json from somewhere; my box is getting bigger with every letter i type"

455,1549994639.1976,Bert,"Well, Ellie doesn't want to load for me. But I would make a subscription to `onAnimationFrame` (or delta) and sort of manually interpolate: `interpolateNumber { oldValue = 1234, newValue = 651 } (millisPassed / animationTotalMillis)`

463,1550101874.2694,Nana,"<@Bernardina> best option for defining CSS in Elm : elm-css
best option for styling/layout in general: probably elm-ui

463,1550102340.2719,Noelle,I’m learning tailwind. Seems good so far; I liked BassCSS

464,1550103760.2759,Nana,"if you're not a CSS expert I would highly recommend elm-ui, it's way easier; but yes elm-css or external css file also works"
464,1550103817.2766,Bernardina,"Well, I have something based on `elm-bootstrap`; <http://elm-bootstrap.info/>; I am not sure if I can use with it `elm-ui`"
464,1550104068.2778,Nana,"ah no elm-ui shouldn't really be combined with a css framework like Bootstrap; though I'm also not sure how well elm-css would interact with Bootstrap - that's kind of the problem with CSS, when you start layering styles on top of each other"
465,1550136753.2813,Anderson,Morning Everyone. I'm implementing a kind of i18n into an elm application. I have a question that could seems dumb. I am storing the formatting for a currency in the main Elm object. Now everytime someone wants to use CurrencyFormat needs to pass the main model. Is there a best practise to avoid passing the main model around ?
465,1550137104.2814,Lynne,"You don't have to pass the whole model to functions which need only currency format. Write functions accepting your CurrencyFormat record and pass only that field when calling them; Something like:
```
displayCurrency : CurrencyFormat -&gt; Float -&gt; String
displayCurrency = ...

...
displayCurrency model.currencyFormat value
```"
465,1550137314.2827,Anderson,"Thanks, I believe I still need to pass the model to who is using displayCurrency"
465,1550137376.2829,Lynne,"Well, it depends on your app structure. The point is you can structure it the way when you pass only relevant data to helper functions; You can't have global variables, so properly structuring your app is the only way to avoid passing the complete model everywhere; Unless your format is constant, of course. Then you can just have another module with function returning it"
465,1550137706.285,Anderson,I am just not used to depends on a main model. ; Thanks for the info.. ill try to pass the correct data in the right function
465,1550137745.2862,Lynne,"I understand that, and, I believe, it is not a super good practice to pass it everywhere as it complicates refactoring"
465,1550137751.2864,Maida,there is a structure that goes by various names but in essence implies that there is a Context in which things happen. This context data is held in a record or some Custom Type and is passed around.; you can take a look at <https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-shared-state>; for inspiration
465,1550137920.287,Anderson,"in my example I have a Main with Locale that contains { Translations, Formatting }; ill have a look; that's was really interesting! thanks! And I believe you can create multiple different sharedState based on the module you are in.; so you only have the dependencies you need in the right place"
465,1550138629.2879,Lynne,I think the point of SharedState is that it is shared between all modules; So you should not need different shared states; Only if your app is split into groups of modules but that's most likely an overkill
465,1550139355.2899,Maida,"Yes, the idea of the SharedState is that it acts like a context for all the places of the app. You can have partitions within this state that handle various aspects."
466,1550139526.2913,Teri,"Howdy everyone!

I wanted to inspect the VirtualDom Kernel code because I am getting it to crash. I would like to make some modifications to it locally in order to fix it.

The problem is - I can not find the source code that actually gets compiled. I am using `elm/virtual-dom@1.0.2`. In the chromium inspector it shows me the line that crashed to be right below
```
	// tag must be 1 or 2 at this point

	var vKids = vNode.e;```; But in the source code of virtualDominside `~/.elm/___/virtual-dom/1.0.2/` it says
```

	// tag must be __2_NODE or __2_KEYED_NODE at this point

	var vKids = vNode.__kids;
```
And when I try modifying this file it does not arrive in the browser when using elm-make.; While googling for `tag must be 1 or 2 at this point` I only got three hits on google which seems really weird.; the hits on google are the compiled results from elm-make."
466,1550139750.2951,Lynne,"It seems like that first excerpt is an optimized version of the second (constants are replaced with values, field name is shortened)"
466,1550139753.2953,Teri,I grepped everything for the comment that virtualdom is crashing on. I can also confirm that the virtual-dom@1.0.2 is the one in my elm.json plus the only one installed in the local ~/.elm directory; I was thinking that too - but does it optimize comments?
466,1550139802.2957,Lynne,"Well, it depends on the optimizer. It can just replace by regex and don't care if it is comment or not"
466,1550139835.2959,Teri,I am wondering if the optimized code is cached somewhere.
466,1550139845.2962,Lynne,I am wondering that also
466,1550139858.2966,Teri,Because that's what I would need to clear then. I tried clearing `elm-stuff` and also `~/.elm`
466,1550139864.297,Florencia,<@Teri> maybe there is some minification going on
466,1550139869.2972,Lynne,That should be enough
466,1550139908.2982,Florencia,"ie. `__kids` -&gt; `e` and `__2_NODE` and `__2_KEYED_NODE` (which are also variable names, not just parts of the comment) -&gt; `1` and `2`?"
466,1550139926.2983,Lynne,But how do you run your app? What you see in the browser is some bundle. Who is producing this bundle?; <@Florencia> I mentioned exactly that two lines above :slightly_smiling_face:; Welcome to the thread
466,1550139973.2997,Teri,Yeah.. I was just double checking it's not inside ~/.elm; (the cached optimized stuff)
466,1550140031.3003,Florencia,"<@Lynne> ah, you're right! I totally skipped your comment :sweat_smile:"

473,1550185450.3455,Claretta,"I would typically change the naming strategy slightly and do something like:
```
type SearchRequest
   = Loading
   | Successful SearchResults
   | Error SearchError
```"
473,1550185473.3457,Marcus,I like that
473,1550185503.3459,Noelle,Ohh I misunderstood
473,1550186038.3515,Marcus,"Quick question about union types and JSON decoding. I moved all of my HTTP code into a module. Within that module, I have a method called `getSearchResults`. That method builds the URL to call to get the search results. The line that does the work is:

```
Http.send msg (Http.get url searchDecoder)
```

searchDecoder looks something like this:

```
searchDecoder : Decoder SearchResultsData
searchDecoder =
    Decode.succeed SearchResultsData
        |&gt; required ""hitCount"" int
```

That's simplified, but you get the idea.

What I actually want is for searchDecoder to return a SearchResults type, where its definition looks like:

```
type SearchResults
    = Loading
    | Results SearchResultsData
    | Error String
```

I haven't wrapped the results of an http call in a union type yet. Can anyone point me to an example or clue me in on the right syntax?; Side note, I realize that searchDecoder won't directly return a SearchResults type, but ultimately the call to `getSearchResults` hits a case in my `update` and I want the type that accompanies the update to be the union type."
473,1550186326.3535,Earlean,<@Marcus> `Http.send` has the type `send : (Result Error a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Request a -&gt; Cmd msg` the key to your problem is the function ` (Result Error a -&gt; msg) `
473,1550186479.3554,Marcus,"Ah, I think I see."
473,1550186510.356,Earlean,"```
resultToSearchResults result = case result of
    Ok value -&gt;
      Results value
    Err error -&gt;
      Error error
```"
473,1550186607.3576,Marcus,I'll give that a shot. Seems clear enough.
473,1550186650.3583,Earlean,"oh, actually. The `error` variable there isn't a string, you'll need to also have a function to convert the `Http.Error` in to a `String`"
473,1550186683.359,Marcus,"That's no problem. So long as the large bits of plumbing are wired up, I can fill in the gaps.; <@Earlean> What would the type annotation be on that function?"
473,1550186930.3601,Earlean,`resultToSearchResults: (Result Http.Error SearchResultData) -&gt; SearchResult`
473,1550186949.3603,Marcus,"Sweet. Thanks.; I'm a little out of my depth on this one.; I think I've got this narrowed down. Last question. When I call `getSearchResults`, I want to tell it which Msg to call. I'm trying this type definition:

```
getSearchResults : SearchQuery -&gt; (SearchResults -&gt; msg) -&gt; Cmd msg
```

where my `Msg` type resembles:

```
type Msg
    = NewResults SearchResults
    ...
```

My intention is to call it like:

```
getSearchResults searchQuery NewResults
```

I'm getting type errors. Do the type annotations above look sane?; Note that the implementation of `getSearchResults` is in a module. `Msg` and the calls to `getSearchResults` are in my main module."
473,1550189088.3694,Nana,"<@Marcus> you could also go with this package: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/latest/RemoteData>
it's a generic datatype for remote data, plus some nice functions like `fromResult`, `map2` etc."
473,1550189170.3705,Marcus,"I'll check it out. I want to get my approach working though. I feel like seeing it through is going to make something click in my understanding of Elm. There's something in the wiring of this that I'm close to understanding, but not quite there."
473,1550189559.3711,Earlean,<@Marcus> what type error do you see?
475,1550189613.3721,Earlean,"The compiler usually provides very good error messages, read the errors carefully"
473,1550189645.3725,Marcus,"Good question. It's shifted around as I've been working on it.; Right now, it says:

```
-- TYPE MISMATCH ----------------------------------------- src/SearchResults.elm

Something is off with the 1st branch of this `case` expression:

209|             callback (Results newResults)
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This `callback` call produces:

    msg

But the type annotation on `httpResponseToSearchResults` says it should be:

    SearchResults

Hint: Your type annotation uses type variable `msg` which means ANY type of
value can flow through, but your code is saying it specifically wants a
`SearchResults` value. Maybe change your type annotation to be more specific?
Maybe change the code to be more general?

Read &lt;https://elm-lang.org/0.19.0/type-annotations&gt; for more advice!

```; I named the `(SearchResults -&gt; msg)` parameter `callback`. Probably not the right name, but that's what it is right now.; I think the signature of httpResponseToSearchResults was off.; I just changed it to:

```
httpResponseToSearchResults : (SearchResults -&gt; msg) -&gt; Result Http.Error SearchResultsData -&gt; msg
httpResponseToSearchResults callback result =
    ...
```

And that made the error go away.; Question though, is there a more idiomatic name than `callback` for that parameter?; Or, a more idiomatic way to indicate what should be called, in the end?"
473,1550189968.3774,Earlean,It's common to call a function intended to produce a msg value `toMsg`
473,1550190001.3778,Marcus,That makes sense.; Gotta run. I'm getting close. Thanks for everyone's help.
476,1550197064.3791,Nga,"How can I convert a `input [typ_=""date""][]` value to a Posix? Seems like elm gets the value as a string when you use onInput (in the format of ""YYYY-MM-DD""); <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time> -- I'm seeing nothing here for converting a string or pieces of a string to a Posix; The old elm stuff has this: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Date> -- I can't find a Date package in the latest core."
476,1550197804.3811,Earlean,"<@Nga> yep, `elm/time` doesn't provide any parsers for handling string encoded date formats. There are other packages for parsing strings in to `Time.Posix`."
476,1550197982.3816,Nga,"<@Earlean> when you say ""other packages"" do you mean stdlib, or third party?; I'm assuming you mean third-party, like this: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-iso8601-date-strings/latest/>

It's a shame that I have to rely on outside packages for something like this :disappointed: Shouldn't Elm support the date input type more thoroughly, and so give us a way to convert a iso8601 to posix? What am I missing here? Seems like an odd decision to exclude this functionality."
476,1550198502.3839,Earlean,<@Nga> if you scroll down to the 'iso8601' section of the Readme you can read the justification for why it's not supported.; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/>
476,1550198855.387,Nga,"<@Earlean> Thanks. I'd say that argument makes a lot of sense if there weren't such a thing as a date input which has very vast browser support. It would also make it easier for people to create custom datepickers. Even just a Posix constructor would be a sufficient work-around, and then people could parse the strings themselves and feed ints to a constructor."

So far, so good. Except for one thing: we're using `elm-webpack-loader`, and we have a main JS file to attach all our elm programs to the nodes they're allowed to squat in the app, and *every time we save one file, all the elm files are re-compiled and added to the main JS file* which is a very long process.
So, is there a way to explain to `elm-webpack-loader` (or webpack?) that it only needs to re-build the parts that have changed and not those who aren't part of the changes?

484,1550238774.4476,Lynne,"I see; But anyways, does this function work?"
484,1550238796.448,Antonette,Sure.
484,1550238799.4482,Lynne,"It is rather different from what you posted above; Ok, so do you still have the problem?"
484,1550238809.4486,Antonette,"(before I attempted to add the configuration for webpack that is); Just so we're on the same page:
- my initial problem is that every time a file is touched, webpack recompiles every page which takes a lot of time ; I'd rather it only recompiled only the pages that are concerned
- in order to attempt to solve the problem, I modified my configuration following the advice given to use the `files` option and attempting to load only one file (the `elm/Main`) ; apparently that does not work since there is no `elm/Main` in my project"
484,1550239024.4491,Lynne,"Aha, so we can drop the second part and only focus on the first one"
484,1550239031.4493,Antonette,"Sure.; So, I stashed all the changes, and it compiles just fine (if unbearably slowly)."
484,1550239086.4497,Lynne,I see; I must admit I don't have ideas regarding this; In my setup there is a single entry point
484,1550239153.4503,Antonette,Arf.
484,1550239380.4505,Agustin,I wonder if you can export your apps; And let elm do the compile; eg have a main module that exports the individual pages
484,1550239436.4511,Antonette,Maaaaybe? How would one go about it?; (because I certainly would try this but I don't know where to start)
487,1550240612.4534,Carmon,"I had this idea for building a page from the contents of a database and building the DOM elements on the fly, but my model would have included something like `thePage: List (Html msg)` which is disallowed. Am I barking up the wrong tree?"
487,1550240768.4537,Danika,"`Browser.document` is what you want; The view function now has the following signature: `view : model -&gt; Document msg` where document is:

```type alias Document msg =
    { title : String
    , body : List (Html msg)
    }```"
487,1550240969.4557,Earlean,"<@Carmon> storing `Html msg` in your model it generally a bad idea, it's better to keep your `Html msg` in your `view` and store a value in your model that you can calculate that `Html msg` from."
487,1550241149.456,Danika,"Oh yeah, and that :'); What's the reasoning behind that"
487,1550241246.4565,Carmon,OK - Thank you! I think I get it
487,1550241267.4566,Tamra,Really? :joy:; Glad to help!
487,1550241547.457,Nana,Storing html in the model kind of breaks the whole reactive/declarative UI idea
487,1550241702.4572,Logan,Yup. An answer in a minute or less. That was great :grinning:
487,1550241726.4574,Nana,Plus I'm guessing maybe there could be serialization issues depending on the internal implementation of the html lib?
487,1550241844.4576,Danika,"Not all UI needs to be reactive.; I think really the point is to not store _functions_ in the model, not so much html in particular"
487,1550242019.4581,Nana,"But then you're no longer following the Elm Architecture; Although maybe some clever stuff could be achieved by storing html :thinking_face: could be worth exploring; But if it's for performance reasons, `Html.lazy` would usually be a better (and faster) solution"
487,1550242387.4589,Antonette,<@Agustin>?
487,1550242511.4591,Agustin,"Well a normal module with the pages exposed, but I think it would depend if the compiler supports it"
488,1550242568.4594,Huong,"compiler needs a `main`.

<@Antonette> I assume you've tried the `files` approach pointing at all files that have a `main`?"
487,1550242742.4597,Antonette,You mean using the `files` option in `webpack.config.js`? When I did just try what I explained that did not work with it (and I did not have a special main file but multiple page files).; <@Agustin> I don't quite know what the normal module with the pages exposed would look like ; if you can point to an example I'd be happy to try :)
487,1550243030.4602,Huong,"Yeah, I think the core issue is that you want elm-webpack-load to understand that `require(""./Pages/App1.elm"")` should be resolved to the same bundle as `require(""./Pages/App2.elm"")`. I don't know if `elm-webpack-loader` has some magic around that :thinking_face:; otoh; you don't need to `require` them separately; <https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader#files-default---path-to-required-file>

So if I follow that, having `files` with a list of the actual Elm modules that expose a `Main`, you can import any one of those and the resulting `Elm` export should have all the modules in it"
487,1550243659.461,Antonette,"Cool, thanks <@Huong> :) trying that right away.; Ok, so I did something similar to what I had done last time:
```
// in webpack.config.js
      {
        test: /\.elm$/,
        exclude: [/elm-stuff/, /node_modules/],
        loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
        options: {
          cwd: 'webpack/client',
          files: [
            path.resolve(__dirname, ""webpack/client/Pages/SomeIndex.elm""),
            path.resolve(__dirname, ""webpack/client/Pages/OtherIndex.elm"")
          ]
        }
      }

// in my index.js
const SomeIndex = require(""./Pages/SomeIndex.elm"").Elm.Pages.SomeIndex;
const OtherIndex = require(""./Pages/OtherIndex.elm"").Elm.Pages.OtherIndex;
...
```; Good thing: it compiles and it works.; Less good thing: it re-compiles everything every time I change one file, even the modules I don't need re-compiled :confused:; (so it's just more configuration that seems to have no impact on what I'm trying to achieve as far as I can tell); Nota bene: it still works even if I give an empty array to the `files` option in `webpack.config.js`. Is this option even doing anything relevant?"
487,1550244904.4624,Huong,"Quick check: Are you still `require`ing them separately, or do you have one single `require`, whose value is reused?"
487,1550244933.4626,Antonette,"I am still requireing them separately. I don't know how to do all in one require.; (because I don't know what the string I should give this special one-time require should be ; I tried `""elm/Main""`, `""elm/Main.elm""`, `""Main.elm""` `""Main""`, `""./elm/Main.elm""`, `""./elm/Main""`, `""./Main.elm""`, `""./Main""`, all to no avail)"
487,1550245346.4631,Huong,"```const Pages = require(""./Pages/SomeIndex.elm"").Elm.Pages;
SomeIndex = Pages.SomeIndex;
OtherIndex = Pages.OtherIndex;
``` I think something like this"
487,1550245392.4633,Antonette,Yep. Nope. I only have `SomeIndex` in `Pages` and not `OtherIndex`.
487,1550245523.4635,Huong,"Hm it _should_ have both :thinking_face:  (at least, according to the `elm-webpack-loader` docs)"
487,1550245551.4638,Antonette,"Assuming those are up-to-date and not buggy to begin with :confused:; (which I'm beginning to reasonably doubt to be honest :sweat_smile:); Since it still works (albeit needing multiple require) when I empty the `files` option array, maybe the paths I was giving it are failing silently?"
487,1550246082.4666,Chae,Does anyone know if there’s a zip/unzip package yet? I wasn’t finding anything in the packages list. Since I couldn’t find one I started looking into making one but got a little stuck on how to got about implementing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE> as it says to look at the individual bits but `elm/bytes` seems to only handle bytes. Sorry if I’m misunderstanding anything.
487,1550246298.4671,Carman,<@Jana> has a tar package that might do what you need <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-tar/latest/>
487,1550246593.4672,Earnest,I always pull out the code for the target branch into a function and just call it from both branches
487,1550246806.4676,Huong,"<https://gist.github.com/zwilias/18c2e87777197450146728e9b8626dcd>

So I adapted the examples from the repo; added `Other.elm` (which just has `module Other exposing (main)` and `main = Html.text ""foo""`); and in my console I see this:; None; So it definitely _is_ possible to get multiple Elm `main` modules with a single `require`, using the `files` option for the loader"
487,1550247293.4689,Antonette,Thanks ; I did exactly that except for the `debug: true` (adding it right now) and that my directory structure is a bit different.; Could it be a version issue?
487,1550247325.4693,Huong,"<https://github.com/zwilias/elm-webpack-loader-example> figured I'd bundle it up for reproduction. The `debug` shouldn't matter, but this makes it a little easier to play around with"
487,1550247349.4695,Antonette,Yep ; I'll see what it tells me about what it does maybe I'll gain insights.
487,1550247500.4697,Huong,"Cool, I hope you'll be able to figure it out! It does sound like perhaps the paths you're giving to `files` aren't quite right for whatever reason!"
487,1550247539.4699,Antonette,"Well, looks like the `debug: true` didn't do squat :confused:; I'm seeing the same feedback (maybe it was already in debug mode because I'm in development mode)."
487,1550247612.4703,Huong,"debug should only impact whether `elm` receives the `--debug` flag (enabling the time traveling debugger); (I've never worked with webpack, so I'm sorry I can't be of more help!)"
487,1550247660.4707,Antonette,Wait... arf. Ok. Got it. I needed to reload the webpack server every time I changed the config apparently...
487,1550247690.4713,Modesto,does anyone write elm in an idiomatic Haskell way?; trying to use typeclasses?
487,1550247709.4716,Huong,Haha
487,1550247720.4718,Antonette,"Don't feel bad, I guess I'm paying for my team and my inexperience at the time we started working with Elm."
487,1550247724.472,Huong,"Yeah, it doesn't reload that, I've noticed :sweat_smile:"
487,1550247754.4725,Virgie,elm does not have typeclasses. Do you mean it the other way around?
487,1550247775.4731,Modesto,like this packages; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/arowM/elm-monoid/latest/Monoid>
487,1550247794.4737,Antonette,"Well, at least I know why what I was doing didn't seem to have any effect on the results whatsoever :sweat_smile:"
487,1550247813.4743,Virgie,"that doesn't really work for the more interesting typeclasses, because in elm a type parameter has to be of kind Type (also written as *)"
487,1550247843.4749,Antonette,Thanks for the serendipitous influence :wink:
487,1550247845.4751,Virgie,"so while that approach works for Monoid, and would for Semigroup, it doesn't work for Monad, Functor, Applicative, Foldable, Traversable, ect."
487,1550247900.4761,Antonette,"Well, you know what it f-ing works!"
487,1550247905.4764,Virgie,"because those all take a type parameter `f`, like in `Functor f =&gt; ` then the `f` is applied to another type. Elm does not currently support that"
487,1550247918.4765,Antonette,(at least I can one-require the modules); Thanks a bunch for all of that y'all :wink:
487,1550247948.4771,Modesto,ok; thank you; I was planning to make a Complex Numbers package; and wanted the type to implement Monoid; off the top of my head I don't know how relavent the other typeclasses are
487,1550248022.4796,Virgie,monoid for numbers is extra weird because there are two sensible instances. Having an explicit name for both operations will be much nicer I think; general tip: look at the elm-geometry api. It takes some really abstract concepts and tries to give good names to the operations you might want to do.
487,1550248123.4806,Huong,Now the real question is whether a change that should only impact one `main` module will recompile them all or not!
487,1550248153.4811,Antonette,Yep ; and that's what I've started to investigate :wink:; But already not compiling X times the file is a big deal.
487,1550248196.4819,Modesto,so the Monoid typeclasses doesn't require a higher kind of type; thank you for another perspective on it
489,1550249782.4893,Floy,"hey,
wanted to talk/ask about one thing. Recently in my project I encountered rather peculiar situation. We had a model for the user that may have the role and permissions against resources. You know, sth along `role: ""admin"", permissions: []`. So the domain of the problem suggested that admin does not need to have any permissions because he can do anything he likes while user can have certain permissions. That's why I modeled the user along this:

```
type alias User = {name: String, permissions: Permissions}
type Permissions
  = AdminPerm
  | UserPerm (Dict Key Permission)
```

don't mind the argument for UserPerm. The point is that I discarded the `role` from the data model in favor of union type with permissions. I wanted to avoid a danger that someone sets the permissions for the admin, which was not suppose to be possible in the light of requirements.

One problem down, another pops up. In view I gotta support changing the user role as well as changing permissions. For the ease of my mind, for now, I had created `type Role = Admin | User` which are only possible to be created manually in the view or derived from existing `User` with a function. However I still feel like I am lacking sth or doing one thing in two places even though you cannot use `Role` directly in the User record.

My question, therefore, is perhaps not related to Elm strictly, more to data modeling with types which, as far as I can tell, is encouraged in Elm.
I am just trying to get ahold of some ideas I might have missed. Wonder if someone had to model user related models in quite a safe way to avoid any weird modifications or states a user can end up. My goal is to make it somehow harder to operate on volatile data behind User model."
487,1550249877.4896,Floy,"I'm putting thread here, in case someone wants to share some experiences :slightly_smiling_face:"
489,1550249996.4899,Floy,"and as usual, thank you for any feedback :+1:"
489,1550250343.4901,Dede,"I'm more used to seeing permissions assigned to roles, and then roles to users who get the union of permissions of their roles.  Is there a reason an entity needs both?; E.g. I'm used to seeing more like this:
```type Permission = Create | Read | ...;

type Role = Role { name: String, permissions: List Permission};

type User = User {name: String, roles: List Role};
```; You can put Resource in at the Permission or Role level, if you need per-resource control."
489,1550250764.4915,Nana,"I think it's not that uncommon to have a system with just permissions and no roles, except an Admin Boolean; I'd probably model it like this:
```
type alias User = {name: String, role: Role}
type Role
  = Admin
  | NonAdmin (Dict Key Permission)
```"
489,1550251035.4923,Dede,"Yeah, that's also perfectly reasonable.  It's just seems unusual to me to try to have both.; But maybe I misunderstood the original intent."
489,1550251641.4927,Floy,"our case defines two roles (admin, user (non admin)) where regular users may have defined permissions (READ, WRITE, DELETE) against resources of specific type identified via ID"
490,1550252165.4937,Emilee,are there any good examples for using the config pipeline pattern? especially with configs that have multiple mutually exclusive options?
489,1550252226.4938,Dede,"```type Permission = Read | Write | Delete

type Resource = ...

489,1550252301.494,Nana,<@Dede> that wouldn't allow a user to have different permissions for different resources though
489,1550252321.4942,Dede,"Sure.  I read <@Floy> as asking for this structure.; If it's per-resource, then it's a minor change:; ```type ResourceAuth = ResourceAuth Resource (List Permission)

tuple Role = AdminRole | UserRole {auths: List ResourceAuth}
```; You could use a record with named fields for ResourceAuth.; You could replace Lists with a set implementation that can handle these types (they're not comparable so stock `set` won't do it.); etc."
489,1550252851.4964,Floy,"we've been using `Dict.Any` library and actually filled in quite nice; `Nothing` returned from there mean for us that user has no permissions against the resource; which is quite nice to have by default; anyway, you're both recommending to actually play around with renaming but also to keep just one type that suggest if user is an admin or not; that's quite ok, unless I have to change the user role in the view; while it works nice for the admin, for user it requires me to create an empty dict inside the view and pass it along the update's msg; or to have a auxilary type, pure view related, to handle that; unless, maybe I can write down changing the role as sort of a toggle, therefore I don't have to pass permissions inside the update's msg, I just change the role to the opposite one; that sort of makes sense I guess; does it? <@Dede> <@Nana>?"
489,1550253305.4984,Dede,"`UserRole` requires the additional data of what are the resources and what are the permissions.; Presumably you have a bunch of checkboxes or something onscreen that provide that info.; Anyhow, however you're denoting it, it's ultimately on your model.; So when you go from AdminRole -&gt; UserRole, you just send a small message from view, and then in your update bit handling the message, you look at the model to pick off the matrix of permissions and resources.; `view = ... button [onClick = SetUserRoleClicked]`; `update = ... case SetUserRoleClicked -&gt; ({model | user = {model.user | role = UserRole (computePermissionsFromModel model)...`"

So you should be asking, when does the model contain such a value?; It's common in ReactJS to do things like `componentDidMount` etc. this isn't how it's done in Elm. Because `view` elements in Elm can't hold state.; the state is in the model"
494,1550312553.5169,Cathey,"Right! Then I need a state in the model, which  controls the visibility of the view… thats the way round….; But however, at some point it has to be triggered by a message… which an elm app can never send itself but only by a Browser.Event or Dom function, HTML request or any other elm function that interacts with the outer world… conclussionn: what I want is not possible in elm, except with binding it to a port and subscribe to that…"
494,1550314505.5174,Earlean,"if you had a port, when would you send to it?; I think you're missing the key point, either you `model` contains a value that would result in that `section` being in the `view` at `init` or some event happens that changes the `model` so that the `section` is in your `view`; if the value is there at `init` then `section` will be in the `view` at `init` so you can do this at `init`"
494,1550314885.518,Cathey,"yes. totally agree. But I did end up myself in a dead-end. I totally messed up my architecture. it works, but does not follow this pattern strictly… :disappointed:"
495,1550315390.5202,Jonna,"Hi folks, I was under the assumption that `Html.lazy` would only be called if the passed value changed, but from this scsee <https://ellie-app.com/4KMM8RhbVpva1> it appears that lazy have no effect (it's called on each frame, not every second as it should)."
494,1550315505.5208,Earlean,"<@Jonna> the function that you passed to `Html.lazy` is a different function each time; the trick to `Html.Lazy.lazy` is that it does 'reference comparison' rather than the usual 'value comparison' in the rest of Elm. This is an optimisation, doing a full value comparison would be very costly and would make the optimisation worthless."
495,1550315866.523,Jonna,ok
494,1550315874.5234,Earlean,<@Jonna> <https://ellie-app.com/4KMW5QMCfxna1> is `Html.Lazy.lazy` functioning as expected
494,1550315878.5236,Jonna,I didn't knew the function reference counted as well
494,1550315954.5246,Earlean,"it must, otherwise providing a different function wouldn't result in a change; which would be very unexpected"
494,1550315974.5252,Jonna,he idea was to throttle as an answer to : <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/many-messages-causes-slow-rendering/3150>; but it's not working as I thought it would (and am pretty sure it was a few years ago)
494,1550316046.5262,Earlean,`Html.Lazy.lazy` has always been reference comparison
494,1550316111.5269,Jonna,"yes, for the value, but for the function I am fairly sure that in 0.15-ish it wasn't checking; anyways; thanks for the clarification :slightly_smiling_face:"
494,1550316194.5284,Earlean,"The thing about `Html.Lazy.lazy` is that it's a transparent optimisation, it works the same whether or not the optimisation is happening or not.; if it didn't compare against the function then it would produce a different result than if it was just `identity` which would be very broken"

``` Type mismatch. Required: (Route, String, String) Found: (Msg, String, String)```"
503,1550385281.6229,Moshe,Hey <@Leopoldo> your problem seems to be `DeletePage`.  `DeletePage` is defined inside your `Msg` type. The thing you want to pass there seems to be `PageDelete` :slightly_smiling_face:
503,1550385401.6232,Leopoldo,ok thanks; None
504,1550394576.6239,Iona,"viewPages is expecting 2 arguments, you’re only provided 1. pass the route in as well; i.e. model.route"
503,1550394800.6244,Leopoldo,what about line 457?
504,1550395296.6246,Iona,"the expression on the right of (::) needs to be a list, so wrap the entire list.map expression in parenthesis or use (&lt;|); the compiler error message says this as well"
504,1550395808.625,Leopoldo,it didnt worked out. <https://gist.github.com/afidegnum/57a63d81f0273e52f6a858282c573734#file-main-elm-L458>
504,1550396254.6263,Moshe,Do we have any mitigation strategies for the error `elm: Map.!: given key is not an element in the map` when using the webpack / rollup loader for elm modules? I found <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1851> but I have not found a workaround to this problem.
503,1550396615.6264,Leopoldo,"this is what i have done and the new error
<https://gist.github.com/afidegnum/76daeb299a593dd4bd4ab9b3e79b165b#file-main-elm-L454-L463>
``` I am having trouble with this (::) operator:
457|&gt;       (text page.title
458|&gt;         :: (List.map (viewLinkOrText currentRoute)
459|&gt;           [ (ReadPage page.id,   ""Read"", (String.fromInt page.id))
460|&gt;           , (EditPage page.id,   ""Edit"",     (String.fromInt page.id))
461|&gt;           , (PageDelete page.id, ""Delete"",   (String.fromInt page.id))
462|&gt;           ] )
The left side of (::) is:
    Html.Html msg
But you are trying to put that into a list filled with:
    String -&gt; String -&gt; Html.Html msg
Lists need ALL elements to be the same type though.
-- TYPE MISMATCH -------------------------------------------------- src/Main.elm
The 2nd argument to `map` is not what I expect:
458|          :: (List.map (viewLinkOrText currentRoute)
459|&gt;           [ (ReadPage page.id,   ""Read"", (String.fromInt page.id))
460|&gt;           , (EditPage page.id,   ""Edit"",     (String.fromInt page.id))
461|&gt;           , (PageDelete page.id, ""Delete"",   (String.fromInt page.id))
462|&gt;           ] )
This argument is a list of type:
    List ( Route, String, String )
But `map` needs the 2nd argument to be:
    List Route

-- TYPE MISMATCH -------------------------------------------------- src/Main.elm
The 3rd element of this list does not match all the previous elements:
213|         [ UP.map ListPage <http://UP.top|UP.top>
214|         , UP.map AddPage (UP.s ""add"")
215|&gt;        , UP.map ReadPage (UP.s ""id"") -- page id
216|         , UP.map EditPage (UP.s ""edit"") -- Page id
217|         ]
This `map` call produces:
    UP.Parser ((PageId -&gt; Route) -&gt; c) c
But all the previous elements in the list are:
    UP.Parser (Route -&gt; c) c
```"
504,1550396759.6279,Lynne,<@Moshe> I think there are two major workarounds: do not use the `--debug` flag and build compiler from forked repo where this bug is fixed as a temporary solution; There is a PR: <https://github.com/elm/compiler/pull/1850> and the respective repo: <https://github.com/tomstejskal/compiler>; In PR there are instructions on how to build it
504,1550396928.629,Leopoldo,"<@Lynne> hi, can you please lend a hand ?"
504,1550397438.6298,Moshe,"<@Lynne> awesome! Thanks for the links.; <@Leopoldo> You are trying to `cons` / `::` a new element to a list. The element is a `Html msg` and the compiler is complaining the other elements in the list are `String -&gt; String -&gt; Html msg`.

This tells us, that the function `viewLinkOrText` is expecting other arguments than what you are handing over.

In your case the function `viewLinkOrText` would need the function signature `viewLinkOrText : Route -&gt; (Route,  String, String) -&gt; Html msg` to fullfil your contract.

So either: you change the function signature of `viewLinkOrText`, or you build a helper function that takes a triplet of `(Route, String, String)` and calls your `viewLinkOrText` function with the unwrapped parameters. :slightly_smiling_face:"
505,1550403830.6365,Leopoldo,hi
506,1550407556.6373,Vilma,I’m having the ports undefined problem in a mini-project. I believe this is because I must declare AND use a port in the Elm code?
506,1550407734.6378,Earlean,<@Vilma> if you don't use a port the compiler will consider it dead code and remove it
506,1550407746.6381,Vilma,yes I read about that; just now in the forum; so I must call the port function in the Elm code?; also is that a bug? :thinking_face:
506,1550407797.6395,Earlean,"It's intentional; if it's an outgoing port then you'll need to have some code that sends to it, if it's an incoming port then you'll need to subscribe to it in your  `subscriptions` function"
507,1550413974.6419,Moshe,<@Leopoldo> did this solve your problem?
507,1550413998.6421,Leopoldo,"yes, i have a full working page <https://gist.github.com/afidegnum/a26cae4270961855e197188c2430f293>; i m now trying to open a form and interact with individual items of the list"

507,1550414073.6429,Moshe,I hope you had some rest in between :smile: and no problem :slightly_smiling_face:

508,1550427749.6464,Dorethea,"You need to be more explicit, do you explicitly send a POST request from Elm code? How do you send the post request from Elm code?; furthermore seems like needs to be asked on <#C192T0Q1E|beginners>"
508,1550427822.6468,Leopoldo,i think the POST is sent from line 175
508,1550428087.647,Dorethea,"in line 138 you are concatanating `links` and `""page""` and `pageid` you do not use any slash, maybe you are passing pageid blank string, that's why it is trying to GET `/page` ?; You should use `/` btw if i'm not wrong?"
508,1550428141.6474,Leopoldo,"well, there have not been a POST request call from the server,; only GET all along; <@Dorethea> you are right  `/page` made it work; it even returned `OPTIONS` i don't know why; but i m still facing the `Cannot GET /pages` error"
509,1550431301.6485,Dorethea,"When you are initializing your app you are issueing fetchPages command, which sends a get request to `/pages` so Elm works; Why your server doesn't work the way you want it to IDK"
509,1550431425.649,Leopoldo,"it's now working, except the `Cannot GET /page` error i don't understand and after submitting the form the url redirects to  localhot:9000/page?"
510,1550440889.6492,Valorie,Are there any plans to make this part of the debugger resizable? Am I missing something?
510,1550441476.6495,Martin,"You can hover the lines and it'll tooltip it for you; not great, but works"
510,1550441721.65,Valorie,that’s better; but still displays an ellipsis if the message is too long
511,1550442244.6505,Lizabeth,I usually end up removing the `width` property from the `sidebar`/whatever the css class for it is so it goes width 100%.

513,1550512327.6672,Elza,"Hello, I have a listing with multiple cards. I was thinking about making cards modular by moving a local state in their own model. no problem for init or views, but how would I target the right subModel in an update function? Is this a good pattern?; I have thought about adding the subModel to the msg, but I do not see a way of updating the parent Model"
513,1550512691.6704,Lynne,"<@Elza> Introducing ""child"" triplets (i.e. modules with their own init/update/view and Model/Msg) is generally not considered as a good pattern but it depends on your app and its structure. For example, it is very practical having single pages in an SPA as stand-alone triplets.; I doubt it is a good idea for cards though."
513,1550512747.6713,Elza,yes that is what I am using in single pages; but I hear you for smaller components; I am considering alternatives; ok; will be using a `Set` instead to mark instances I need instead of submodules/child triplets
513,1550512835.6724,Lynne,`Set` can only contain comparables; You are probably after the `List`
513,1550514986.6728,Elza,"sorry i meant a `List` containing models, with a `Set` to tag some of them by `id`"

515,1550533603.675,Marcus,"Has anyone seen any info on how to create an interface like this using native Elm (i.e., not using ports)? I don't have a specific application, it just looks like it would be cool to make.; BTW, that's a shot from Twilio Studio - a tool for visually creating messaging flows."
516,1550535021.6762,Vashti,"I'd be interested in that, I'm looking to build a graph (nodes and edges) editor in Elm; I'm not sure how to describe such an interface; ""canvas interfaces"" maybe (as in the user can somewhat arbitrarily place and move objects on a canvas); but the word canvas already has a specific meaning when it comes to webdev"
515,1550538701.6797,Marcus,"I'm not sure either. FWIW, the implementation of that interface is all SVG. I was worried it might be HTML Canvas, but that's not the case, fortunately.; I'd probably describe it as a workflow editor.; This gets close, but looks like a piece of a larger platform, not a stand-alone component: <https://www.totaljs.com/flow/>"
515,1550540216.6814,Vashti,<@Marcus> I guess you could build the svg based on input messages using elm/svg somehow and then render that; the problem is you'd somehow have to keep track exactly of where every element in the svg is on the page?; so that you can correctly interpret a click; which sounds scarily like it could get very platform dependent quickly
515,1550541214.6868,Marcus,"<@Vashti> I think you are right about the implementation. You'd need to store the x,y location of each node in the workflow. The edges between them could be calculated on the fly. I'd probably set the center of the design surface to be 0,0 and allow nodes to be placed anywhere in relation to that. The messages would be something like `AddNode`, `DeleteNode`, `NodeDragging`, and `NodeDropped`. I'm shooting from the hip a bit there, but that's where I'd start."
515,1550541321.687,Vashti,"yup, sounds about right; my only worry is converting window level coordinates that the browser sends you on a click to surface coordinates; I'd need to be certain the SVG was being drawn _exactly_ where I thought; and I kind of have a hunch that's a dangerous assumption to make"
515,1550542601.6895,Marcus,I don't have my head around that one either. The examples I've seen of drag-and-drop functionality with Elm haven't been great.
515,1550542890.69,Vashti,"<@Marcus> got any examples you could share off the top of your head?; I may have to move away from elm, or just use ports for that component of the UI"
515,1550543528.6908,Marcus,One sec. I'll see if I can find it.; <https://github.com/wintvelt/elm-sortable-list>; There's one. There's another that I'm thinking of though. I feel like it came with the old Elm mouse event library.; This just came up in my search: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbzNit_D98Y>; That looks interesting.
515,1550543699.6924,Vashti,thanks very much
515,1550543737.6932,Marcus,I feel like `elm/browser` got some updates in 0.19 that might help. Unconfirmed though.
515,1550543837.6937,Vashti,oh that talk is _very_ interesting; I don't know if it's something supported natively by the svg package but they can set mouse event attributes directly on their svg nodes
515,1550543906.6946,Marcus,Interesting. I didn't know that.; I need to improve my SVG knowledge.
515,1550543976.6951,Vashti,"<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/svg/latest/Svg-Events#onClick>; well, that means it's considerably easier than I expected"
515,1550544023.6959,Marcus,"Yeah, the `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` seem like they would do the trick."
515,1550544042.6961,Vashti,that's very nice
515,1550544168.6983,Marcus,"Thinking out loud, when a new node is added to the design surface, I'd record its x,y coordinates in my model. On `onMouseDown`, I'd record the node that was selected and subscribe to `onMouseMove` events. As `onMouseMove` events come in, I'd update the x,y coordinates. On `onMouseUp`, I'd unsubscribe from the `onMouseMove` event.; I'm not sure what the algorithm is for drawing the edge between nodes. It's probably not that complex."
517,1550555368.7011,Jacquelyn,"Anybody know how to have an incoming port with no input? From Firebase, I want to let my Elm app know that the user logged out, so I have this in my JS:

```
port loggedOut : msg -&gt; Sub msg

You can probably just use `Json.Decode.succeed` for the decoder in that case."
517,1550555991.7022,Lizabeth,"I’ve updated my answer to check properly what we were doing.; But I’m not sure if that is the proper way to do it, it just worked for us, so I kept using it."

I don't think this is possible at the moment.

Would like some opinions on the matter. Does this break some stuff and remove any sort of type safety? I do not think it does.
If this does already exist then please tell me so I can delete this question :stuck_out_tongue:"
521,1550572978.7146,Niesha,"I think you can do that with extensible records, although that functionality has been pruned in 0.19. Btw, I think the term you're looking for is ""structural typing""; It's basically duck typing, but with types; As opposed to nominal typing"

521,1550575430.729,Lynne,"<@Leopoldo> It really has nothing to do with Elm. Your Elm app is compiled to JavaScript and served as regular JS file, which, in turn, is linked from some HTML page (typically, `index.html`)."

521,1550588244.7486,Ashton,"Okay. Thank you. Maybe if we just render every document with a `div []` at the top, then it will be protected from browser extensions adding things to the bottom, since the Elm virtual dom will never care about things below the solitary top `div []`"

526,1550592240.7538,Earnestine,"if you add an `type alias` for a record, Elm gives you a positional constructor for free to create it. this is extremely useful for applicative style json parsing (e.g. with the json-pipeline package)
What do you think, are there other use cases where the the constructor should be used? Concretely, would you create larger records like
```
type alias User = { name: String, age: Int, active: Bool, items: List Product, sessionId: Id }
```
rather like this:
`user = User ""Me"" 33 True [] (Id ""235423"")`
or
`user = { name = ""Me"", age = 33, active = True, items = [] , sessionId = Id ""34321"" }`"
526,1550592352.7545,Rosa,"its used in Decoders, but other than I prefer the record style, even for small ones"
526,1550592504.7559,Lynne,"The downside of using this constructor is much worse readability. Also, if you have, say, two adjacent `Int` or `String` or whatever fields, it is very easy to put them in wrong order and compiler won't help you with it"
527,1550592766.7565,Paulita,Hi Chad! I am using 0.19.0 and I haven't run into any issue so far.. what problem exactly you're facing?
527,1550595362.7601,Romona,"Hopefully someone could answer that. I'm using parcel to bundle code and I've got an issue with assets.

I'm using assets as suggested in elm-spa example : <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Asset.elm>

However parcel does not bundle any of these images. The following library does load them to dist : <https://github.com/tiaanduplessis/parcel-plugin-asset-copier>

but image names are suffixed with hashes and Elm code does not know that files are being suffixed."
527,1550595814.7614,Timika,"Something like `parcel build --no-content-hash src/index.html` could help you a bit. Files will still have a hash to them, but it _will not change_ based on the content but is static as long as the path to them does not change.; AFAIK there is now way for parcel to know that you use your assets and cannot rename paths to them in your Elm code. So this (together with `parcel-plugin-asset-copier`) might be a decent workaround.; (Disclaimer: I’ve never used `--no-content-hash` with `parcel-plugin-asset-copier` in production, this is merely an idea); (More disclaimer: This will also mess with HTTP caching if you serve your assets with an nearly-infinite `max-age` which is what is usually done when using content-aware hashes. This can be circumvented by using a different cache strategy though.); Alternatively, you could `import` your assets in your JS bootstrap code and pass the paths to Elm via flags and use them in your app instead. This way you don’t have to mess around with plugins, can keep content aware hashes and nearly-infinite `max-age` caching with the cost of handling flags, passing around your image paths to every view that uses them and more (albeit simple) javascript.  Let me know if anything above helps. :slightly_smiling_face:"
527,1550596572.7681,Donella,I'm using a JS module containing imports of the assets and an Elm module with the type for the assets and a JSON decoder. Then I pass the assets to Elm application through the flags.; I wrote myself a little tool in Haskell to help me generate these modules from a directory content.
527,1550597036.7707,Romona,"Ah pity there's nothing that would handle that by default.

I'll try to use flags as you've suggested and see where it will lead. Thanks <@Timika> :slightly_smiling_face:"
527,1550597611.7721,Danika,"I have used flags for this, and seen flags recommended more than once. Seems like the common solution. "
528,1550598153.7722,Ashton,"I just have a screenshot from someone who tried out our new system, from the console saying over and over again about a `childNode` being missing, and the tester clearly has a lot of browser extensions."
529,1550598725.7725,Elina,"hey folks. can anyone help me with a naming question?

there's a fairly common pattern I've seen where a custom type is used to make a record opaque to the client code that uses it:

```
type State =
    State InnerState

type alias InnerState =
    { foo : String
    , bar : String
    }
```

is there any good naming convention for these? ""inner"" seems a little off to me, and if there's something the community uses, I'd be happy to prefer that."
529,1550598743.7726,Noelle,I use `Internals`; I don’t rememer where I saw it
529,1550599365.774,Timika,"Or just don’t alias it at all, depending on your module, this works well. "
530,1550600968.7744,Carman,"I often use some variation on `State` for the internal value and something more descriptive for the outer one.; An interesting example is this type from a tower-defense game that has several tags, each of which wrap some kind of state record:

    | TowerPlacementPhase PlacementState

531,1550604974.7756,Reuben,different vertex shapes are on the road map; <https://github.com/erkal/kite/projects/1#card-13685869>; What exactly do you want to do? Maybe I will have time in a week to work on Kite.
532,1550607431.7879,Kathlyn,"Big trouble with browser extensions and  third-party trackers and other scripts.

We have a bit of a problem. We finally after several weeks of hard work were able to convert from 0.18 -&gt; 0.19. We use a fullscreen elm application to be able to control navigation etc. We deployed and people starting complaining about nothing showing up in the browser! Oh no!

Turns out that these people had browser extensions that injected things into the &lt;body&gt; tag of every page (Yikes). But that is unfortunately “the real world” where people have crap like that. Adding anything not controlled by Elm to the body will make Elm throw errors over and over - which is fair.

Unfortunately this completely stops the application from running, and means you cannot make a website based on Elm fullscreen - it simply might not show for many users :S

It also means that you cannot use some tools like Hubspot or Drift for forms and analytics, because you often have no control over where they inject their iframe tag (meaning the end body usually).

A solution is to use an embedded Elm application, but that limits navigation in your elm app, which is a huge sacrifice to make. The best solution in my mind, would be that Elm fullscreen applications could be added to a top level wrapper element in body, and Elm would ignore anything outside that.

Does anyone have any suggestions or have solved similar problems?"
532,1550608396.7881,Velia,"You are not alone:
<https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C0CJ3SBBM/p1550586877742000>

I think that this issue has been underestimated because it was not that bad in 0.18.

It could help to open an issue on github and post again on discourse until the problem gravity is correctly assessed. Then maybe something will be done.

I think that Elm takes the whole body with `application` to be sure that it is alone handling navigation. But this indeed backfires with extensions.; This mainly happen with `Browser.application` that takes the whole body. See also <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C0CJ3SBBM/p1550607431787900>"
532,1550608719.7889,Simon,"<@Kathlyn> yes,; same issue; I used our gulp pipeline to hack the elm output to take the “fullscreen app” and sandbox it an element down; so we could continue to work w/ all popular integrations; ```
// Monkey patch step to work around Elm's Browser.application deficiencies.
// Please see VENDORHACKS.md for more details
gulp.task(""build:scripts:elm:monkey-patch"", () =&gt; {
  const originalApplicationBodyLoadingCode = ""var bodyNode = _VirtualDom_doc.body;""
  const isolatedApplicationBodyLoadingCode = 'var bodyNode = _VirtualDom_doc.getElementById(""elmIsolationContainer"");'

  return gulp
    .src(output)
    .pipe($.replace(originalApplicationBodyLoadingCode, isolatedApplicationBodyLoadingCode))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(outputPath))
})
```; this gives you the best of both worlds, the full-screen full on Elm mode in 19, but isolation to work with Intercom, Hubspot (presumably Drift etc); we also have a little runtime dance to get around ad blockers preventing Segment&amp;Elm from loading as well; happy to share more if interested; Note: this is a different issue from browser extensions messing w/ other parts of the Dom, we have punted on that for now; I believe I filed a bug for this (if folks want to upvote it)  - Elm is too opinionated on its fullpage mode to work w/ normal B2B addons"
532,1550609036.7935,Kathlyn,I am very interested in knowing more; Sounds horrible; I am reopening the Elm discussion in the forum
532,1550609087.7949,Velia,"But the whole `&lt;body&gt;` control is new to 0.19, and only `Browser.application`. So maybe Evan is not conscious yet of the issues raised. It does not look good from the various reports."
532,1550609149.796,Simon,"I recall bringing it up and being dismissed months ago. Constructively, I’d like to encourage the folks who shepherd that feedback to be a little more curious, I’m unsure how to achieve that"

532,1550609425.7988,Simon,"Emotional memory says the vibe was not sacrificing Elm’s correctness for broader ecosystem impurity; If you think this is the worst hack we’ve done, ask me about my compiler hackers :wink:"
533,1550610659.7994,Vashti,"<@Reuben> I'm building an interface for this language: <https://timothyatkinson.github.io/gettingstarted.html> so I just need a simple editor that I can query the state of to ""compile"" my program, and also control the state of to apply a few invariants to the rules, and produce output graphs"
533,1550610876.7997,Ashton,"Haha, yep. Not a coincedence either."
533,1550611039.7999,Velia,I see. I was suspecting that :wink:
532,1550611555.8023,Kathlyn,"That is problematic view imo. If Elm is to be used in real applications like ours, we have to face the facts and balance purity and pragmatism. This effectively makes any Elm applications unusable by a large segment of users"
534,1550612705.8027,Agustin,"You can work around it easily enough I think?; You need to either add a wrapper div, or use element with an external wrapper div."
534,1550612831.8047,Kathlyn,"<@Agustin>That’s just it. You can’t. Fullscreen will always use the entire body element in 0.19. If you embed you app in a wrapper you cannot control navigation, which means you cannot to a SPA like ours"
534,1550612892.805,Agustin,Ah so just the first option applies then; You can add the wrapper div inside your elm app; I believe; The virtual dom then doesn’t get out of sync and it doesn’t blow up
534,1550612996.8069,Simon,"<@Edwin> it won’t work, because if another JS package has written to Body, elm will overwrite it once it “boots”"
534,1550612999.807,Agustin,Similar to how the “web components” hack works
534,1550613007.8073,Simon,so it’s also a bit of a timing issue
534,1550613084.8094,Kathlyn,Jon you have no control of the external scripts or extensions. I cannot wrap them if that is what you are suggesting. I am not sure how web components fit in here.
534,1550613086.8096,Simon,"(as an aside, we make extensive use of web components elsewhere and are fond of the technique; we use it for avatar img fallbacks, algolia-based search, ChartJS fully implemented in Elm types but rendered via web component etc)"
534,1550613113.81,Kathlyn,We use webcomponents for Code Mirror and Charting
534,1550614140.812,Shondra,"<@Edwin> you can control navigation using `element`, here's a tutorial <https://github.com/elm/browser/blob/1.0.0/notes/navigation-in-elements.md> , it's not as pretty but it's possible"
534,1550614372.8142,Kathlyn,"Ludat thanks for the link, and sure, but we have a huge app that is fully Elm. The page starts with (Many companies introduce Elm gradually.). This is how we did in 0.18, and would prefer hacking the resulting Js like <@Simon> compared to this - which is a complete departure from the new navigation api."
534,1550615304.8161,Agustin,"<@Kathlyn> web components work because you have an element created by elm, and they manipulate the insides, the vdom is happy."
535,1550615330.8167,Agustin,"I’m suggesting a work around whereby you add an elmement at the top of the vdom, so it stays happy when other elements are added alongside it"
534,1550615349.8171,Agustin,AFAIK its the getting out of sync that makes it unhappy
535,1550615374.8174,Agustin,"You are welcome to ignore me though, just trying to help :slightly_smiling_face:; Sorry that sounded passive aggressive, what I mean is, I’m trying to help, but if I’m not thats ok :slightly_smiling_face:"
534,1550615462.8194,Kathlyn,I did not mean to sound ungrateful. :smile: I just genuinely do not see how it would help. And how adding more items (through the vdom would help)
535,1550615503.8209,Agustin,It’s a trick for sure
535,1550615503.821,Ashton,"Wrapping stuff in a div is only going to protect against stuff getting added to the bottom of the `&lt;body&gt;` right? It wont protect from things getting added to the top.; Thats my suspicion. It would be cool to confirm this.; (if you render just `&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;stuff&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;` The vdom is going to look for the first element, find it, and be happy, it wont care about any sibling elements since it doesnt believe they exist, but, if something else is first, it will find the something else, which it wont expect, and subsequently crash)."
535,1550615657.8234,Agustin,"yes thats my belief; born out of experience with web components; the vdom cares about what it knows about, and ignores that it doesnt, but if the “streams cross” it gets mad"

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=""root""&gt;ELM APP STUFF HERE&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""injected-extension""&gt;ELEMENT INJECTED BY EXTENSION&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

Where do web components come into this picture?; This is correct. But take something like google tag manager, it will add things at the start of the body. Then you are screwed."
535,1550616188.8259,Stacee,"this is weird question but does this js port code look weird to you ?; context: I am working with a pretty gigantic SPA, and with the elm debugger not working so I am debugging things randomly to understand what is going on; the problem: I can’t get the onEventSteam port to fire again if I reload the page but if I get there by being routed (i.e.e elm changing the url) then it works :confused:"
534,1550616322.8294,Kathlyn,Looks fine. The only thing is you are sending error and event directly to Elm. Do you have full control over the content of those and are they the same format?
535,1550616387.8306,Stacee,<@Kathlyn> thanks for the anwer! Jes the are Values and I just do a ghetto try two decoders one for the data and one for the error and return a custom type :smile:

534,1550619193.8348,Kathlyn,"For completion I am adding my solution to the browser extension problem above. It is a dirty hack as suggested by <@Simon>. But it does exactly what we need, nests the fullscreen app one level down from body. It is a webpack loader that transforms the resulting js source. Use at your own peril! And lets pray for the elm gods to find this despicable enough to merit a patch.; ```

What is the expected way we should use outbound nullary functions? Is it `port signOut : () -&gt; Cmd msg` and in the `update` function: `( model, signOut () )`?"
548,1550712031.0134,Earlean,"<@Jacquelyn> yep, but it's generally an anti-pattern to not send a value on your port; It's recommended to have 1 outgoing and 1 incoming port for each 'process' (aka. actor) you're communicating with.

555,1550774166.0431,Rosaria,"Hey folks. I'm staring at a problem in Elm where there seems to exist no great way to integrate gRPC. There are indeed no libraries that solve the problem, although there are two protocol buffer libraries that could be leveraged to help.

My problem is that grpc-web (the protocol that we'd need to implement) is obviously low level javascript-y http/2 type stuff. The definition of kernel code. Is there some process by which I can begin developing a module that's intended to fit into the kernel of Elm? And would it ever be accepted? Is there any process for this?"
555,1550774390.0438,Moon,almost done now!
555,1550776867.0456,Lynne,<@Rosaria> I think Evan mentioned somewhere that he prefers seeing posts at discourse/Reddit where the needs are stated and some feedback is gathered. It could be a good place to start and see if there are people who are interested in having Elm gRPC implementation as well.
556,1550776925.0466,Agustin,"Have you considered a port that wraps anything you can’t do in Elm due to browser apis?; You have access to some http request stuff, but maybe make a http 2 equivalent?"
555,1550776958.0476,Rosaria,The comment about browser APIs is a limiting factor to implement gRPC in pure javascript and doesn't really concern elm fwiw. Port or no port you still can't do it.
556,1550776975.048,Rosaria,"Hence grpc-web protocol is a stop-gap to enable clients to talk ""a form"" of grpc"
555,1550776996.0487,Agustin,If you can do it in JS you can do it in ports.
556,1550776999.0488,Rosaria,"Being that it's not possible to implement grpc in pure javascript, the proposal would target grpc-web instead.; Yes, you're getting confused with what that statement meant. I'm trying to clarify.; :slightly_smiling_face:; It's an important distinction that there are two protocols, and one is impossible in pure JS and hence impossible with a port.; And that we'd be targetting the one that IS possible in pure JS &amp; ports. :slightly_smiling_face:; <@Agustin> Also fwiw the purpose of grpc is to have low latency and performant serialization. Using a port forces me to serialize to json, which then gets converted into an object in JS land, which then is serialized to binary. Not very efficient :confused:"
556,1550777276.0525,Agustin,If its impossible in pure js without a port it’s impossible in elm
556,1550777284.0528,Rosaria,I literally said that.; I'm not arguing.; lol.
556,1550777327.0537,Agustin,"Ok cool, going back to your original statement I think Elm isn’t the right choice for you.; There is no way to do what you want.; Short of Evan blessing you with an exploration repo. You can’t do it.; And there are very little active exploration repos; Not even WebGl has made it to core, and websockets got left behind in 0.18"
556,1550777440.0559,Rosaria,Websockets being left behind is a little concerning.; But it sounds like this is simply a people problem. Perhaps it can be solved with discussion like Sergey mentions.; Also - I'm already fairly invested in Elm.; This is a change we want to make on the backend.; So Elm either comes along for the ride or we'll have to abandon the idea and try something strictly worse. Like REST/JSONAPI/Swagger.
556,1550777520.0578,Agustin,"GraphQL; There are beautiful GraphQL libraries in Elm, run on standard protocols"
556,1550777541.0587,Rosaria,Standard protocols are the strictly worse part.
556,1550777556.0591,Agustin,The beauty of GraphQL is its not wedded to them; It runs on them but when HTTP/2 HTTP/3 is ready it’ll run on them too
556,1550777586.0598,Rosaria,HTTP/2 is ready and I'd be concerned if it didn't run on them :confused:
556,1550777613.0605,Agustin,Not all webservers etc…
556,1550777617.0606,Rosaria,etc.; Does GraphQL solve the problem of describing an APIs methods/serialization?; I know precious little about it.; But that's the root of the problem we're trying to solve.
556,1550777670.0622,Agustin,"You describe a schema of what is available; You write queries / mutations / subscriptions to pull / change / stream that data; You specify what the api supports, and what your client needs; Serialisation is standardised based on the schema; docs for fields / objects are returned via introspection"
556,1550777775.0648,Rosaria,I'll look into it. Maybe it's another solution to the problem.; Though it still seems like it'll have the same old performance as a random rest API. One of the reasons for choosing gRPC was specifically that.; Will have to evaluate. Thanks for your input.
556,1550777860.0671,Agustin,It runs over any protocol; So its common to use websockets etc to improve the push -&gt; pull time
556,1550777887.068,Rosaria,But those were abandoned in Elm 0.18 :disappointed:
556,1550777907.0684,Agustin,"No because its trivial to use ports for them; (Theres no deserialisation overhead, as its sent straight to the websocket); but yes websockets use json, and not some binary format"
556,1550777962.0703,Rosaria,How is that possible? If it goes through the port it must be serialized somehow no?
556,1550777968.0705,Agustin,sure; it just does it before the port; rather than after; its going to be serialised if you send it over a websocket; :slightly_smiling_face:
556,1550777991.0722,Rosaria,So the json object the port is carrying is just a string then?; And de/serialiaztion happens on the elm side?
556,1550778031.0729,Agustin,Totally; I send some pretty hefty data that way; (basicall graphql’d equivalent of 100mb csvs); The bottleneck is not my ports I can assure you; (it may help my data is streamed)
556,1550778128.0757,Rosaria,"Okay, so we're at least in theory avoiding double encoding (though I don't think that's true because somewhere that string is still probably going to get a `JSON.stringify` to go through the port, though it may be trivial performance wise even for large data).; Anyway, all besides the point."
556,1550778230.0782,Danika,There’s no stringify that happens when going through ports. 
556,1550778230.0783,Rosaria,<@Agustin> The most important thing however that you haven't touched on is is there code generation for these GraphQL things? Do I have to write clients for it by hand with support libraries?
556,1550778271.0791,Agustin,"No, the most popular library generates elm for your graphql; You still have to couple that to your code"
556,1550778282.0797,Rosaria,"Okay, that's a huge relief."
556,1550778286.08,Agustin,But the “decoding” is handled
556,1550778398.0813,Rosaria,"<@Danika> Ah I see. Before the json passing in ports occurred, elm had hardcode support for its basic types through ports.; That's excellent news."
557,1550781143.0841,Cherish,"Hey there, I am searching for the complete schema of ""--report=json"" compiler flag... is that JSON schema just the same for every type of error/warning/message ?; currently I am reengineering the schema from concrete error messages, but that seems somewhat inefficient and tedious.."

559,1550783804.094,Kaitlin,"TLDR; contextually rendered UI loses bindings in IE 11

Hi there, I have the singular misfortune of having to support IE11 for our app, and while it works reasonably well, there is an issue where the app seems to lose its binding for overlays, i.e DOM that is rendered contextually based on a user interaction.

I can verify that if I render the overlay on page load, I can interact with it ( (I can verify the responsiveness by watching the elm debugger), but when I close it and reopen it the overlay eventually loses it bindings, and becomes non-responsive. By eventually, I mean that I can reopen and close the overlay 0 or more times, but typically no more than 5, so this suggests that perhaps the issue is in IE’s event loop handling of the runtime, which, well, is not a cause for much optimism that this issue is easily fixable.

Has anyone else experienced this issue with IE11 and if so, how did you mitigate it.
thanks all!"
559,1550784033.0956,Huong,"By loses bindings, do you mean there are no event handlers registered, or do you see errors in the console when interacting?"
559,1550784071.0962,Kaitlin,there are no console errors or elm debugger updates
559,1550784189.0984,Huong,"That's pretty weird! I've had issues where events would result in errors due to some weird edge case with html.map that only pops up in IE 11, but haven't run into a complete lack of interaction!"
559,1550784371.0988,Kaitlin,"yeah, it’s very weird!; <@Huong> you are a genius. your comment about Html.map inspired me to look at how I was constructing the DOM where the overlay was rendered, and indeed I was doing something rather weird with Html.map

basically I was doing this:
```div [] &lt;|
    List.map (Html.map myFooMsg)
        [ viewNode1
        , viewOverlay
        , viewNode2
        , viewNode3
        ]```

when I should have been doing this :

```Html.map myFooMsg
    &lt;| div [] 
        [ viewNode1
        , viewOverlay
        , viewNode2
        , viewNode3
        ]```; using the latter structure makes my overlay 100% functional.; I’m not sure why that would be the case, but i know the original way I was doing it is obviously not idiomatic"
559,1550786410.1067,Huong,"Yeah, that's actually the bug I was referring to. Having an indirection between the node and the mapped contents seems to make this problematic, for whatever reason. Anyway, glad that helped!"

562,1550791209.1118,Kris,"You have mostly 2 options for doing it synchronously, something like this: <https://medium.com/@jjant/making-elm-unsafe-cc6435495af2> or using a trick with decoding/encoding a proxy; These are not the officially recommended options etc etc"
562,1550791341.1122,Kathlyn,"<@Cammy> Yeah, was hoping for an sync way of doing it as the thing I have to integrate with requires it. Thanks all the same"

570,1550844920.1418,Nana,"Oh, that's kind of what I'm doing too! Although for me it's actually more our Java developers. My boss was more ""reliability sounds good""; Ah thanks, I see :thinking_face:"
570,1550845237.1423,Charley,<@Nana> We're dedicating our time to it next week without fail so maybe we could share ideas as we go through? If you could put the word out maybe we could collect some wider experience for everyone!
571,1550846741.1432,Randi,Hi! Does anyone know the algorithm used for the Elm type checker?
570,1550846850.1433,Nana,I think it's based on this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system>; <@Charley> I just heard from <@Carl> (Microsoft) they are going to be recording for the next episode of the elm-town podcast today
572,1550850397.1445,Sherilyn,We don't differentiate internally either; Eg I used to do mostly Backend and now I write a lot of elm.
573,1550853342.1454,Hoa,Having big names always help :slightly_smiling_face:
573,1550853854.147,Lavon,Does anyone know if its possible to change the location of the elm-stuff directory? (Not to be confused with the .elm directory.) I'm trying to work around some unfortunate read-only drive problems and it would be great if I could move it to another location.
573,1550853947.148,Huong,"`elm-stuff` is always created in the same directory as your `elm.json`. However, you might be able to move your `elm.json` and update its `source-directories` entry accordingly?"
573,1550854020.1486,Carl,"while we do use Elm at Microsoft, we're just a small team inside a huge company. I don't think the TypeScript people or VSCode people are even aware of what our team is doing"
573,1550854096.1496,Lavon,If I can automate copying it to another location and updating the source-directories list dynamically that might work...
573,1550854167.1501,Huong,"If namedropping is the goal - there's a team at adobe that uses Elm, and Amazon AWS had a job-listing for Elm engineers too, a year or so ago."
573,1550854169.1503,Crissy,You could copy the whole source directory from the read only drive to one with write access?
573,1550854325.152,Lavon,"Yeah, that's an option too. I was hoping I could just change an environment variable to make it all work, but it looks like I'll have to do more than that :confused:"
574,1550870615.1552,Karan,"hi, i'm trying to build the elm compiler from its source. i tried to build it using stack, but `stack init` fails because it does not find a suitable resolver. any hints?"
574,1550871024.1556,Garnet,Is there some component/package to use the bluetooth web API in Elm?
575,1550873842.1559,Bert,"I don't think so, but you can use ports to interact with any browser API"

It happens on running webpack with --development, not with --production. And it just started all of a sudden between 1 compile and the other.; never mind, I deleted elm-stuff and it went away."
576,1550912853.1596,Lynne,"<@Salvador> That's a compiler issue, on Github there are few threads discussing it. If it comes again and removing `elm-stuff` won't help you can try running `elm make` without `--debug` if it suits you or build elm compiler from a forked repo where this bug is fixed"
576,1550912932.1605,Salvador,"<@Lynne> Aha, thanks for the info. For the moment it’s compiling fine. But I’ll put it on my list."
575,1550914270.1607,Garnet,"Yeah, just wondered if thers some Elm package ^^"
577,1550943995.1625,Santina,"I'm using Visual Studio Code and just started a new elm project, but I can't seem to get it to reformat my code on save like it used to in my old project. Anything in particular I need to do? I'm using the Krzysztof-Cieslak/vscode-elm extension"
577,1550944338.1648,Monnie,"Does it format manually ?  (Shift+Alt+F)
in that case it must be your settings.. there is a Format on save settings in vsCode.. There is also a timer soewhere... I found that it has to be set more than defaul 1s.. when I changed mine to 5s it works every time.."
577,1550944725.1651,Santina,Hmm. It just doesn't seem to like my code. Compiler errors.; does elm compiler require a Main.elm?; I'm starting my writing the shape of my data; didnt want to dive into wiring the boilerplate yet
577,1550944801.1659,Monnie,not sure.. never tried without main :slightly_smiling_face:
577,1550944889.1673,Santina,"Does elm compiler require a Main.elm to exist before elm-format will function? I'm starting by writing out the shape of my data and wanted it typechecked as well as the benefit of elm-format, so i've started writing some real basic static data, but elm-format shows me compiler errors with *very* basic data that *should* compile okay"
577,1550944970.1678,Dede,Compiler will compile any file you point it at.  The errors are probably real
577,1550945017.168,Santina,"example: <https://gist.github.com/bstro/22585039e6b61211a245b335131c27ef>; In the past, elm-format would rejigger that `data = ...` clause to be pretty and compile; I guess it does compile correctly if I put it all on one line."
577,1550945144.1692,Dede,"You just can’t have the comma immediately after the newline.; Put a space in front of it, and elm-format will take over from there."

578,1550946405.1706,Vilma,does anyone have any idea on how I can solve this: <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/issues/9> ?
578,1550946879.1707,Huong,"I haven't encountered that error yet. Just to be sure - ~/.elm isn't mapped, right?

The edge case I'm a little worried about is having `elm-stuff` from the host VM having to correspond to `~/.elm` on the guest. This shouldn't be a problem is the `elm-stuff` on the host is never touched (i.e. _all_ `elm` interactions happen exclusively on the guest), but you never know.; In other words, does clearing `elm-stuff` on the host (and perhaps `~/.elm` on the guest) help, or is this a persistent issue?"
578,1550947007.1734,Nana,"Ah yeah if you have elm-format, I think you can put commas etc. on the beginning of a line, and it'll fix it, but if you don't, you get a compiler error"
579,1550948082.1739,Malinda,Since 0.19 I have issues with auto format on save both in Atom and VS Code; I just run a batch script once in a while for reformatting all of my files.; Or sometimes call elm-format from the terminal of Atom; I'm on Windows 7 though
579,1550948287.1747,Monnie,"I'm on windows 10 and 0.19.. I also had problems. But after changing the ""Format On Save Timeout"" to 5000ms in vscode settings it has been working on every sngle save for a few months :slightly_smiling_face:"
579,1550948326.1749,Malinda,hmm let me try that; I don't even see that setting :open_mouth:; None; I get this error on saving:; None
579,1550948585.1763,Monnie,Here is mine.. not elm format settings.. but vs code settings; im in vs code... and using elm-format globally installed by npm...

580,1550950361.178,Charley,<@Huong> Not so much name-dropping as knowing who to go to for a few more stories/back up on why Elm is the right choice for a plethora of use cases; Showing growth always helps!
580,1550950458.1784,Huong,"Oh, yeah, I didn't mean to use that as a pejorative term - showing that established organizations use Elm is never a bad idea! :slightly_smiling_face:"
581,1550960944.1799,Karan,"I'm trying to build the elm compiler and `cabal build` says ""can't find source for Elm/PerUserCache""; has anyone run into this?"
581,1550961011.1803,Huong,<#C0VHPC4F3|compiler> is probably a better channel for this kind of question. As a general note - `master` isn't stable - you might have better luck building the 0.19.0 tag
581,1550961239.1805,Karan,"ok, thank you"
582,1550992294.181,Mozella,I want to publish an elm package; How should I structure the json?; is there any guide?
582,1550993012.1817,Lea,Have you seen this <https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/docs/elm.json/package.md> ?
582,1550994697.1824,Mozella,"Okay, so now I am at the point where it is asking me to tag my release; I ran the commands that the command line recommended and I see a ""release"" on github; aaand I figured it out; <https://github.com/bowbahdoe/elm-history/releases>"
583,1550998143.185,Lea,Is this a bug? <https://ellie-app.com/4Pj7WpKzTHKa1> The iframe embedded through the markdown package always reloads if you run any update; Keying the node makes no difference
582,1550998211.1861,Mozella,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/bowbahdoe/elm-history/latest/>
583,1550998221.1865,Lea,Embedding with `iframe [] []` works fine
583,1550998222.1866,Mozella,(happy for myself)
583,1550998353.1875,Earlean,<@Lea> because you're just inserting a string of HTML the virtual DOM doesn't know about it so it can't do the diffing that it would normally do
583,1550998699.1895,Lea,"I expected keying the node to would prevent this behavior. Since Markdown.toHtml returns Html msg, I also expect it to behave like a Virtual Dom node; (I understand why it doesn’t)"
584,1550999790.1908,Huong,Does making it lazy help?
583,1551000011.191,Lea,"Nope; If I read this correctly, it should also compare the provided String <https://github.com/elm-explorations/markdown/blob/1.0.0/src/Elm/Kernel/Markdown.js#L37>; But Virtual dom ‘custom nodes’ compares the nodes before it compares the diff <https://github.com/elm/virtual-dom/blob/1.0.2/src/Elm/Kernel/VirtualDom.js#L817>; Which will always be true, because of the creation of a new node by `_Markdown_render` <https://github.com/elm-explorations/markdown/blob/1.0.0/src/Elm/Kernel/Markdown.js#L33>"
585,1551002304.1936,Huong,"Right. So easy way out - wrapping it in a lazy div :sweat_smile: this doesn't sound intentional, though - probably fair to log a bug on the markdown  repo :thinking_face:"
583,1551003474.1939,Lea,"K, I’ll file a bug, thanks for taking a look!"
585,1551003755.1941,Huong,"Hold on, it should work with lazy :neutral_face:; <https://github.com/elm/virtual-dom/blob/1.0.2/src/Elm/Kernel/VirtualDom.js#L733> which should end up in there; <https://ellie-app.com/4PkzsFfMLksa1>
<https://ellie-app.com/4PkBNVJsKnka1>; appears to work, as long as all params are constants (which makes sense, since that's how lazy is supposed to work)"
585,1551003900.1949,Lea,Ah you’re right; I did <https://ellie-app.com/4PkDx6XdYq6a1>
585,1551004199.1953,Huong,"```(Markdown.toHtmlWith
                { defaultOptions | sanitize = False }
                []
            )``` won't evaluate to a referentially equal result every time it runs, though; in other words, `lazy (fn arg) otherArg` and `lazy2 fn arg otherArg` do different things. Additionally, `{ defaultOptions | sanitize = False }` also evaluates to a new record every time it is evaluated, so that also doesn't quite work"
585,1551004392.1957,Lea,K cool; Still file a bug?
585,1551005032.1961,Huong,"It seems to work the way _I_ would expect it to, but if that doesn't match your expectations, it's still fair to file a bug - perhaps we need to explain how `lazy` and `Markdown.toHtml*` work together better"
585,1551005266.1963,Lea,A note in the `Markdown` docs might be nice indeed; I’m always having a hard time figuring out referential equality; Mostly because I never took the time to look it up _and_ understand it :sweat_smile:
585,1551006808.197,Huong,"Yeah, it's a very weird case. Knowing the implementation of things, it's rather predictable, but I can't think of a very simple guideline that doesn't have a whole bunch of exceptions. Like ""expressions evaluate to new values"" isn't universally true - `identity foo` evaluates to something that is referentially equal to `foo`. ""Only top level values"" isn't true either - things could perfectly well come from your model and work just fine. Hm. This is a tough problem :sweat_smile:"
585,1551008014.1974,Lea,"Ye, that’s what I’m missing, it’ll might end up being an intuition thing at some point after seeing a lot of cases"
585,1551019884.1978,Janiece,Looks pretty nice! API seems pretty clean and readable
586,1551019890.198,Janiece,And :thumbsup: for taking the time to write good docs; Did you take a look at existing packages like <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/undo-redo/latest/>?
587,1551029526.2014,Moriah,"Hello. I’m encountering some performance problems when running `Browser.Dom.getElement` on about 30-40 elements using `Task.sequence`. It seems like Elm is scheduling all the tasks in the sequence to be run one at a time, one on every animationFrame. Can someone confirm or deny that?"
587,1551030543.2024,Donella,<@Moriah> the documentation says the tasks will be run in order one-by-one
587,1551030651.2035,Moriah,"I’ve read that as well. I just wasn’t sure that it would run them at the speed on 1 task per animationFrame.; It basically means that for every 60 tasks that sequence I will have to wait an extra second for the resulting `Cmd` to finish, if it turns out that my assumptions are correct."
586,1551037880.2057,Mozella,"The other package named elm-history has a pretty non open-source license
<https://github.com/iodevs/elm-history/blob/1.0.0/LICENSE>; And that package, while it does do a good deal more than what my package does, exposes the internals of the type; The benefit of an opaque type here is that i can treat it somewhat like an interface and potentially add optional features like size caps without breaking consumer (my) code; That being said... I didn't really do my due dilligence; Egg on my face; I just saw the other elm-history plugin's restrictive license last night and was kind of... reactionary"
588,1551040237.2073,Tamiko,"`elm make` is producing blank html pages, I’m running `0.19`. Anybody else experiencing this? I have no issue running `elm reactor`"
588,1551041965.2082,Virgie,"do you have a `main` function? if there is no main, the elm compiler will not produce any output <@Tamiko>"
589,1551062987.213,Earlean,"<@Moriah> `Task.sequence` will run a list of tasks one after another. `Browser.Dom.getElement` gives you a Task that waits for the next animation frame before querying the DOM. The behaviour of `Browser.Dom.getElement` is like that so that you can return it from `update` and have it act on an element that will be in the DOM after the next call to `view`.; <@Moriah> doing `Browser.Dom.getElement` for 40 elements doesn't seem like a common use case, can you expand on what you're trying to achieve?"
589,1551078138.2143,Moriah,Thank you for your reply. I’m working on a drag-and-drop thing. I use `getElement` to get the positions and dimensions of potential drop targets.; I managed to work around the problem using ports.
590,1551087132.2164,Elza,"Hello! I published a second version of a package, but it is not listed in the version list. I used `elm bump`, tagged the commit, pushed it and did `elm publish`... What did I do wrong?"
590,1551087241.2169,Jin,Might be cache related. What is the package?
590,1551087258.2171,Elza,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/adauguet/elm-spanned-string>; there should be a `1.0.1`; you can actually see it in the search
590,1551087311.2182,Jin,I’m seeing `1.0.1` there.
590,1551087402.2186,Elza,"cache-related it was, sorry for asking"
590,1551087459.2195,Jin,This question comes up every now and then. :slightly_smiling_face:
591,1551098192.222,Emilee,"have any of you people had experience with using entity component systems for ""databases""? We need a global datastore in our application that stores ""needs"". those can be in many different configurations, so it's hard to model the whole system with sum-types (they can be loaded, loading, failed to load, they can be owned or not owned, they can have different types, and, technically, multiple of them....); i'm trying to weigh how many guarantees i lose or gain by using this modeling method, vs how easy it is to use for developers; also, there's the question of how composable selectors on this structure would be"
591,1551099113.2235,Maida,<@Emilee> maybe this talk could be useful: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OdemxhfbU>
591,1551099181.2246,Emilee,"yep, i know the talk, but it has more to do with relations, not composable types i think. of course those compositions could be modeled as relations, but that's basically what i would do for an ecs^^; i feel like we have a backend that's radically opposed to strong typing^^' (everything's rdf)"
592,1551103467.2294,Iva,How’s your Norwegian skills? Not directly elm related but this talk discusses using a flat “triple” format over the wire and how to work with it. Might provide some inspiration. <https://vimeo.com/289851906> (if you don’t understand anything you might be able to get some meaning from the slides around 15 mins until 22 mins) 
591,1551103502.23,Emilee,"ummm.... not^^ but i'll look into it, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:; our wire format is rdf, and our frontend so far has been a mashup of jsonld and pseudodefined data, so i guess the topic applies^^"
593,1551109330.2311,Danika,Nothing to add but its cool to hear sem-web things being used in the “real world” 
591,1551112488.2317,Emilee,"well... ""real world"", we're an industry-oriented research studio; <http://matchat.org|matchat.org> &lt;&lt; our current proof of concept application, written in angular 1.x and redux.
I'm working on bringing it to elm, which is proving to be quite difficult because of the interplay with angular, and the untyped nature^^"
593,1551112593.2333,Danika,"awesome, thanks for the link :slightly_smiling_face:; are you doing any sparql things?"
591,1551112649.2347,Emilee,"our backend is. we have some small parts in the frontend, but the js implementations seem quite slow, so our current app state is jsonld which is treated as json, and some other javascript derived data; but for our application to run entirely in elm i *will* have to create at least an rdf library, maybe with querying capabilities"
591,1551112768.236,Danika,"I TA a semantic web class for my supervisor, I always struggle when students ask my why they should really care"
591,1551112818.2364,Emilee,"it's a hard question to answer, because most of the benefits can feel kind of esoteric; (maybe we should move that conversation to <#C0CJ671HU|random> ^^)"
591,1551112864.2373,Danika,#semanticweb the people demand it!
593,1551113553.2391,Karan,Looking at `elm-spa-example` I see a lot of type variables being used (compared to what I'm used to in Haskell). Is there a convention or rationale behind this?
593,1551113613.2395,Danika,I think a lot of haskell code goes out of its way to be incredibly terse or “clever”
591,1551113968.2403,Karan,"Maybe, but why would I not constrain types as much as possible?"
593,1551114059.2407,Danika,can you give an example on elmspa?
594,1551114832.2409,Lea,"Ah you’re right, I didn’t expect it to behave like that. If you don’t mind getting each element individually you could Cmd.batch a list of them <https://ellie-app.com/4PTCnfvTMRda1>"
593,1551114932.2418,Karan,<@Danika> For example here: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/c8c3201ec0488f17c1245e1fd2293ba5bc0748d5/src/Api.elm#L138>
593,1551115084.2423,Danika,"I can see why it is like that, but I don’t know enough about Elm to explain to you why that makes sense"
594,1551115107.2428,Nana,I think giving `Model` and `Msg` as concrete types would create a circular dependency between Api and Main
593,1551115125.2433,Danika,"if you look where that is actually used:

```main : Program Value Model Msg
main =
    Api.application Viewer.decoder
        { init = init
        , onUrlChange = ChangedUrl
        , onUrlRequest = ClickedLink
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , update = update
        , view = view
        }```

You can see the unbound `model` and `msg` types become concrete"
593,1551115151.2434,Nana,"it could ofc. be solved by moving them from Main to their own files, but I guess he didn't want to do that"
593,1551115321.245,Karan,"I saw that. I was just wondering, because `Api.application` is only called once (i.e. the concrete types are known)."
595,1551120112.2457,Saran,is it possible to expose a type alias without exposing the type it's an alias of?
595,1551120321.2461,Virgie,yes; often happens when a module exposes an alias for a type defined in an `*.Internal` module
596,1551121805.2474,Jae,"Hi, I'm getting this exception when running tests ```The dependencies in your elm.json are not compatible.

Did you change them by hand? Try to change it back! It is much better to add
dependencies with elm install or the dependency management tool in elm reactor.```
It happened after I installed some new packages (though not by hand).; I sort of remember having this error before. Someone was nice and solved it for me but I've since forgotten the solution and the answer is probably past the 10k message limit"
596,1551122071.2477,Lynne,"Try removing your `elm-stuff` folder to start with; You don't have separate `elm.json` in your `tests/` directory, do you?"
597,1551122433.2481,Kathlyn,"Sure. The point is to improve fullscreen, so you don’t have to work around the nice new API to get a working real world application <@Huong>"
596,1551122541.2484,Huong,"Oh, not disagreeing, merely pointing out options to unblock yourself, and sharing my experience with a workaround"
596,1551122694.2486,Jae,"No, just one elm.json; Deleting elm-stuff didn't change the error"
596,1551122768.2491,Lynne,Both good and bad; Try this tool: <https://www.markuslaire.com/github/elm-dependencies-analyzer/>; It will show if there are conflicting dependencies
596,1551122837.2497,Lindsey,worst case scenario is a new elm.json and install each package with elm install
596,1551122840.2499,Lynne,"If it does not help, then the only (tedious but bullet-proof way) is to remove all deps from `elm.json` and start adding them one-by-one with `elm install`; Yep"
596,1551122926.2504,Jae,`Selected versions have no conflicts.`
596,1551122942.2506,Lynne,Well...
596,1551122944.2508,Jae,I guess it's the tedious way then!
596,1551122949.251,Lynne,I hope you don't have that many deps :slightly_smiling_face:
596,1551122986.2512,Jae,I have a few but I know which commit caused the issue so I only need to look at the packages I installed there
596,1551122987.2514,Lindsey,Seems like it would be possible to cook up a shell script to do it semi automatically... maybe one rainy afternoon.
596,1551122990.2516,Lynne,Don't forget to clear indirect deps also
596,1551123090.2518,Jae,"Alright, thanks. I'm going to put it off for now but I'll need to sort that out eventually; Once I've figured out which package causes the tests to no longer work, do I just have to never use that package?"
596,1551124150.2523,Lynne,"Hopefully, that's just a version conflict"
596,1551124185.2525,Jae,How do I figure out what the version conflict is if the dependency analyzer says there are no conflicts?
596,1551124193.2527,Lynne,"If not there are few options: upgrade/degrade other packages or skip using that one, at least until it is upgraded (not necessarily never); Well, I am curious why dependency analyzer says there are no conflicts, but honestly it is not the first time it says this but in fact there is a conflict; So hopefully `elm install` will just resolve it for you; I can't say that dependency analyzer is 100% reliable unfortunately and it is not official tool"
596,1551124393.2535,Jae,How do I tell `elm install` which version of a package to use?
596,1551124705.2538,Lynne,"There is no way to do it, it always installs latest version which is compatible with your other dependencies"
596,1551124757.2541,Jae,"Well, I tried to two possible versions of the test incompatible package and neither worked so I guess I can't use that package anymore.  At least it's not really important"
596,1551124760.2543,Lynne,"You can however try upgrading or degrading a package by manually changing version in `elm.json`; Yeah, that may be true; What was the package if I may ask?"
596,1551124794.2549,Jae,`noahzgordon/elm-color-extra`
596,1551124885.2551,Lynne,"I don't see anything criminal with it but if removing it helps you resolve your issue, that's great; What version of `elm-explorations/test` are you using?"
596,1551124941.2555,Jae,1.2.0
596,1551125153.2557,Lynne,"It must be something not related to versions, may be some module names are clashing?; Could not find proof for it though"
596,1551125275.2561,Jae,Installing `elm-color-extra` installs `elm/regex` and `fredcy/elm-parseint` so it might be something wrong with those instead
596,1551125909.2563,Lynne,Yeah
596,1551126474.2565,Jae,I tried creating a new project with elm init and then installing elm-color-extra.  I still got the same error after trying to run tests
596,1551128748.2571,Lynne,So it may be an answer

598,1551148557.2601,Raymonde,"<@Noelle> The debounce functionality is ok, the problem is the response handle logic."
598,1551148942.2605,Earlean,"Lots of ways to add ordering to the responses, you can add a timestamp of the request time and drop responses for earlier requests, or have the response include the value of the request and check it still makes sense"

599,1551181393.2664,Lynne,"For example, when network connection is dropped. Also, server may decide to close connection for whatever reason.; It just can go wrong at any point in time :slightly_smiling_face:"
599,1551182058.268,Karma,"Good to know, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Also, does refreshing the page break the connection?"
599,1551182576.2682,Lynne,Definitely

600,1551188643.2703,Karma,Another web socket related question: I want to send a message from the client to the server every time the connection is started. Is this possible?
599,1551188875.2705,Jin,"Yes, it was somehow harder then switching from Elm 0.18 to Elm 0.19; but mostly because of dependencies"
600,1551188956.2709,Karma,I already have a Cmd action that sends the message but have been having trouble figuring out how to link it to the websocket connection opening :shrug:
600,1551190648.2711,Lynne,"If I remember correctly Elm's Websocket module queues messages you send if there is no connection and sends them as soon as it is established; Ah, you want to send on restarts also"
600,1551190790.2715,Karma,Yes. The idea is that the first message that I send it a token that the server can validate. So I need to send it every time the connection is restarted
600,1551190818.2717,Lynne,You may want using `Websocket.LowLevel` then. `Websocket` does not notify you when opening or reopening happens
600,1551190893.2719,Karma,"I looked into that library a bit, but what confused me about it was how to make a subscription out of the functions there"
600,1551190909.2721,Lynne,"Though it probably means you would need to provide your own effect module; Which is hard, not documented and not supported anymore :slightly_smiling_face:"
600,1551190965.2725,Karma,"Well then, I'll try and find another solution to my problem :stuck_out_tongue:"
600,1551190965.2727,Lynne,"I would say send a ""hello"" message from server when the connection is opened if you own the backend; Then you could react on it in the client requesting a token"
600,1551190994.2731,Karma,"Yes, I do. I was thinking of something along those lines.; Thank you for your help :slightly_smiling_face:"

600,1551191656.2799,Moshe,"Do you have recommendations on how to handle dropdowns?

If I see it correctly there are currently three packages for 0.19 that provide such functionality. Hence I wondered, if these are what anyone is using OR if everyone is rolling their own OR if most are simply using the standard html `&lt;select&gt;`"
600,1551191726.2804,Carman,Use the standard HTML `&lt;select&gt;` unless you have a good reason to do something else
600,1551191791.281,Moshe,"I suspect “the designer does not like it” is not a sufficiently good reason, right? :smile:"

600,1551192198.2867,Moshe,"Well the comment was a little tounge in cheek, sorry :wink: Actually the main problem, most of the times, seems to be additional wishes for the look and feel.

600,1551192764.2886,Carman,"I have a form that needs to:
• auto-save on blur

I like its approach to building forms but my use-case departs significantly from its defaults. The package provides the ability to add custom fields and behavior although it looks like I may need to do some significant work to meet my needs.; Alternatively, I'm looking at just building my own form from scratch but I'm afraid I may end up duplicating a lot of the customization work I would have done with the package solution above so I'm questioning if it's worth it. Thoughts? :slightly_smiling_face:"
600,1551193054.2922,Dede,It's open source?  Clone it into your project and hack it until it fits?
600,1551193131.2931,Jin,"I really liked playing around with composable-form in its default state, also with custom view functions. But building custom fields was really not that simple. iirc there are plans to improve the experience for that. The motivation to play around with the library was to possibly switch away from a different one. My current stand is to build my own form, pulling out functionality on the way."
600,1551193189.2932,Carman,The package is built to be extensible. My concern is around whether its worth doing the work to extend versus just rolling my own form since my use-case is so different than normal

After sending data out through the first port, I have no way of deciding which textarea was actually pasted into when the subscription is triggered.

622,1551346884.0141,Lewis,"_shadowing_ means that you “hide” another name. since you already had the name `a` in your scope, when you also declare a parameter named `a` for a function, the outer `a` will be hidden (“shadowed”) within that function."

622,1551347171.0147,Sherill,hi everyone; i'm using this library (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ryannhg/date-format/2.3.0/>) to format dates; and I'm having difficulties in passing a custom timezone for formatting purposes; it seems like the only zones we can have using the official `Time` package are `utc` and the local one (using the task `now`); am I getting this correctly? thanks
622,1551347321.0166,Lynne,That is correct <@Sherill>; You can build your own `Zone` objects using `Time.customZone` however
622,1551347385.0178,Sherill,"okay so for example, if I am developing a finance webapp that shows different times/dates from different timezones all over the world; I have to develop a `customZone`, which seems intended for package developers only; am I right?"
622,1551347444.0192,Lynne,It is not that you have to develop a `customZone` it is that Elm currently does not have built-in support for such use case; You can however use <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/isaacseymour/deprecated-time/latest> until an official package appears

624,1551358924.0282,Leonore,"Hey all! What do you think would be the advantage of using a `Request` instead of a `Task` when making Http requests? You can chain, map tasks much easier."
623,1551358989.0287,Huong,The latest incarnation of `elm/http` did away with the `Request` type :slightly_smiling_face: <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/Http>
623,1551359079.0291,Leonore,Ok sure but you can still create a `request` instead of a `task`
623,1551359132.0295,Huong,"Well, you can either create a `Cmd` or a `Task`; The advantage being that most requests have no benefit from going through the extra step of being a `Task` first, since they need to be executed eventually"
623,1551359242.031,Leonore,I guess I don't understand why that is an advantage
623,1551359473.0341,Huong,"Let's make sure we're on the same page, though. The current API allows (very straightforwardly) to create a simple request to get/post/whatever something over HTTP by means of a `Cmd msg`. Sometimes, more complex scenarios are required, where requests need to be chained. For that scenario, it also allows creating a lower level `Task x a`. Does that make sense?"
623,1551359501.0343,Leonore,Yes
623,1551359564.0359,Huong,"Alright, so can you re-frame your question with that information in mind? I'm having a hard time understanding what the question means, right now :sweat_smile:"
623,1551359984.0413,Leonore,"Haha. Well, ok an example might make more sense. Let's say I have a request that grabs some element `Item` depending on an `id`. Some parts of the code I know what the `id` is so I just use that. In some other cases I have to grab the `ids` from another request and then sequence the requests to grab each `Item`. I can only do that with `task`s. Now, I have an `Api` module that contains all the get/post etc. There, I have to add new ones just for the tasks and write `Resolver`s just for them instead of `Expect`s. My question was that what if I just scrap that and use tasks for everything? What are the reasons not to do that if any? Note that I have to write some type of `expect` anyways because we also lose data on the errors with the new api."
623,1551360598.0476,Huong,"It's quite possible that for your use-case, using `Tasks` for all requests and converting to `Cmd` as required is more convenient. In my experience, chaining requests isn't a very common requirement (it sounds like the API isn't really making it easy to work with it :sweat_smile: ), so I definitely see the advantage in the ""make the simple things easy, make complex things possible"" approach that was used for the 2.0.0 version of the library. The main difference between a `Resolver` and an `Expect` (in the lower level interface you have to use if you need the body from a failed request) is that you have to provide the `(Result x a -&gt; msg)` when setting up the `Expect`, while you only supply that same function to `Task.attempt` when dealing with a `Resolver`. So the building blocks are the same, the difference is in where you need to supply them"
623,1551360676.0489,Leonore,"Yes, but there are also some other cases like maybe you want to make the call after some delay.; Then you need a Task again; Thanks, I was just wondering if there was an advantage to using the `request`s; Upgrading to 2.0.0 increased the code for me :sweat_smile:"
623,1551360757.0513,Huong,"Yeah, or using 2 messages, for people who prefer to stick to `Cmd`'s. Fair question, though!; I think you may be able to refactor that quite a bit by sharing the `(Response String -&gt; Result x a)` functions, and setting up some higher level helper functions for constructing your requests as tasks or as commands as you see fit. I'll be honest, I haven't upgraded our primary project to elm/http@2.x yet, because I know it'll be quite a bit of work :smile:"
623,1551361077.0536,Leonore,"Yeah, fair enough; :smile:"

625,1551369329.0584,Kris,"Yep; As an analogy, `res : Result x Int` means the same thing, that it can't be an `Err`"
625,1551369428.0597,Yang,im gonna test it but i think it will not compile since `x` is not `Never`; it supposed to be a Never such that it mapps the type asked by Task.attempt; i think
625,1551369571.0612,Kris,"Well, it's polymorphic, so you can specialise the type variable to whatever you want; I.e, ```myHere : Task Never Time
myHere = Time.here``` should compile just fine"

629,1551386095.084,Dayna,"There is something that has been bothering me for a long time, is there a way to model my Elm app as a state machine so that the compiler can know that the app is already in some state and I can skip checking for impossible states? For example: (1) an action can be dispatched only if the user presses a button, (2) that button is shown only if the data has been loaded from the server, (3) therefore I don't have to check if the data is loading in the update for that action. I know doing that in Elm is probably impossible but I'm really interested in learning about tools that enable that."
629,1551386383.086,Carman,"It's tricky if your system is asynchronous like Elm. Consider the following scenario:
1. A user clicks a button when the app is in state `A`. This fires a (slow) HTTP request in the background
2. While the request is happening, the user clicks another button, transitioning the app to state `B`
3. The HTTP request finally completes, triggering a message; Normally you'd only expect the message to come in when the app is in state `A` but because messages are asynchronous it could definitely come in during state `B` (or `C`, etc); I think that in a state machine with asynchronous events, any message _could_ happen in any state"
629,1551386579.0897,Dayna,Well if modelling such state transitions was possible then surely you could model the possible transitions that can happen during loading of the request
629,1551386601.0902,Alleen,"if your `Model` is an enum you could do something like

```
case (model, msg) of
    (ModelStateOne stateOne, MsgOne) -&gt;
        -- handle this case
        (model, Cmd.none)

    _ -&gt;
        (model, Cmd.none)
```

it’s not as clean as you’re hoping, but it could work; enum =&gt; custom type; i’m too used to Rust right now"
629,1551386678.0918,Dayna,"Sure, but I'm more interested in a way to model the transitions upfront and then have the compiler force me to prove that the model is in the correct state (request loaded etc); The only practical solution I can think of right now is to put the button click message inside the model and when the request is loaded to partially apply the response data to the message so that when the view renders the response: (1) view is forced to pattern match on the response to extract the message it should send and (2) the update will also get the response data from the message, not the model and it will be confirmed to exist. This is all very theoretical and hacky, of course, but I can see myself playing with the idea"
629,1551386985.0974,Nana,"Right, so the issue is that you have two values - model and msg - and you need to combine their types in some way :thinking_face:"
629,1551387412.1017,Dayna,"The more I think about it, the better it sounds :smile: I'd imagine a model with
`article : WebData (Article, { editArticle : Msg })` where the editArticle message constructor is actually `Article -&gt; Msg` but the update function will partially apply the data when it's returned from the server. The view will pattern match on the article in the model to extract the message for the edit button and the update will grab the article by pattern matching the message."
629,1551387544.1034,Leoma,"So, if your model only represents legal states, and you write a transition, you can’t possibly have a problem.
You can’t write a transition that accepts an illegal state, or creates one.
Can you tell us more about the problems you’re solving and why you focused on this idea of a state machine?"
629,1551387670.1058,Dayna,"The problem is that 90% of the code I write (and I imagine most boring CRUD apps are like that) is requesting data, showing stuff on the screen and sending requests when the user presses something. On every `XButtonClicked` message I have to pattern match on the request to get the data and since the request could be loading, I have to add a branch like in <@Alleen>’s example"
629,1551387821.1089,Nana,<@Dayna> you could get the data from the view like `onClick (DoStuff loadedData)` but I think that can cause some concurrency issues?
629,1551387872.1098,Dayna,"That's also a way to do it, but I think the theoretical API I showed above is a bit more reliable and also it doesn't involve the view knowing what data the update needs"

631,1551429260.1267,Lynne,"<@Deane> I pointed to the problem in my last statement :slightly_smiling_face: You return `Foo` but `makeUpdater` says it should be `Things` (either `Good Foo` or `Bad Foo`); So you should have written, for example, `Good &lt;| updater foo newNum` in your first branch; And I think it still won't compile because `a` is too generic in your case and compiler will force you changing signature of `updater` to `(Foo -&gt; Int -&gt; Foo)`. If you want a generic signature you should write something like:
```
type Things a 
  = Good a
  | Bad a

makeUpdater : Things a -&gt; Int -&gt; (a -&gt; Int -&gt; a) -&gt; Things a

633,1551433928.1329,Daysi,"Hi. I currently trying to upgrade from 0.18 to 0.19 and ran into a package dependency thing. I used elm-upgrade for the job and now I swapped the packages which don't support the new elm (sortable-data-tables and date-format) manually for their new forks:
""evancz/elm-sortable-table"": ""1.0.1 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"", -&gt; ""billstclair/elm-sortable-table"": ""1.1.1 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"",
""mgold/elm-date-format"": ""1.6.0 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"" -&gt; ""ryannhg/date-format"": ""1.6.0 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0""; now I'm stuck in this situation:; so elm-upgrade says ""dependencies are fine"", `elm make` says ""dependencies are not good""; can someone point me in the right direction?; Help is appreciated"
633,1551434185.136,Jin,<https://www.markuslaire.com/github/elm-dependencies-analyzer/> is a tool to help you work out dependency issues
633,1551434201.1364,Deane,"<@Lynne> yes, you're correct when you say ""And I think it still won't compile because `a` is too generic in your case and compiler will force you changing signature of `updater` to `(Foo -&gt; Int -&gt; Foo)`""; And yes looks like the solution is basically that `Things` will become `Things a`; thanks!"
633,1551434290.1374,Jin,"elm-upgrade will only check that your dependencies are Elm 0.19 ready, afaik. Elm will check if the dependency constraints fit."
633,1551434301.1377,Lynne,You are welcome <@Deane>
633,1551434316.1378,Daysi,"thanks! but the tool says ""Only application elm.json is supported, not package elm.json.
If you would find it useful to also support package elm.json,
please open an issue at GitHub repository."" when I upload my elm.json; I thought elm-upgrade automatically upgraded the file to the correct structure but maybe there is an error?"
633,1551434373.1382,Jin,"You have to put in the elm.json of the full application, not of one of the depemdencies."
633,1551434381.1384,Daysi,I did
633,1551434392.1386,Jin,"maybe, yes. your elm.json must be of type application; and your versions there must be fixed, no ranges"

634,1551436860.1443,Tawnya,"Hey beautiful people. I have the task at hand of given a sentence in a string, get all urls in the sentence.
I found out that elm/Url parser accepts things like <http://word> as valid urls, which doesn't work for us.

In writing a Url parser I arrived at a point where I have a big list of domain extension names (.com, .org, .gov) and need to match against that.
I'd like to do it without backtracking to keep things fast, so I'm thinking of building a *prefix tree* out of my list and will create my parser out of that.

Is there a better way to do the matching against the list? If not, could anyone recommend a library to build prefix trees? The rluiten/trie doesn't seem to allow the mapping from Trie -&gt; Parser that I need."
634,1551438405.1452,Lynne,"<@Tawnya> Is not `Parser.oneOf [keyword "".com"", keyword "".org"", keyword "".gov""]` sufficient?"
634,1551438653.1464,Tawnya,"But from what I understand `Parser.oneOf [ keyword "".com"",  keyword "".<http://co.uk|co.uk>"" ]` would fail for `.<http://co.uk|co.uk>` values; Unless I used backtracking.; Is that right?"
634,1551438820.1476,Lynne,"Not sure, why would it? .com and .<http://co.uk|co.uk> don't have a common ""superstring""; Meaning there is no string for which both .com and .<http://co.uk|co.uk> are substrings; From what I see from `Parser.Advanced.keyword`'s definition, it does not progress if there is no match, so no backtracking is needed"

636,1551449316.1581,Daysi,Elm told me to write `import Bla exposing (Blubb(..))` instead of `(Blubb(Foo))` just before that. I corrected it but now Elm says something isn't right in an Elm package that should work ... So I wanted to ask.
636,1551449356.1586,Virgie,"in 0.19 you either import all variants/constructors, or none of them.; this makes sense if you pattern match on a value of the custom type: you need all constructors to make the pattern match exhaustive; on the other hand it is now a little harder to see where a name comes from"

639,1551455100.1673,Daysi,can someone point me to an in-dept explaination of the elm.json? <https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/docs/elm.json/application.md> is not enough for me
639,1551455155.168,Mindy,what are you missing ?; because there isn't anything more to elm.json than this and the <https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/docs/elm.json/package.md> version
639,1551455255.1701,Daysi,"why?
A: I get ""module not found"" errors when `elm make`ing all Elm-apps for my big, multipage app. The ""source-directories"" in my elm.json are just like in the old elm-package.json. But now the compiler doesn't find modules anymore ..."
639,1551455295.1703,Dorsey,"Aw, silly me. The repository name did not match package name!"
639,1551455312.1705,Daysi,"None; ""source-directories"": [
        ""app/fas_ui"",
        ""app/fas_ui/demo""

639,1551455476.1735,Dorsey,I think the message from `elm publish` could be improved and say something like `no repository by this name on <http://github.com|github.com>`.
639,1551455491.1742,Mindy,Do those directories directly contain your elm files ?
639,1551455498.1747,Daysi,does Elm try to look not in the project root but takes the node_modules/.bin/elm as root and looks for node_modules/.bin/elm/app/fas_ui  or something?
639,1551455514.1751,Mindy,Maybe you should put `app/fas_ui/src/elm` in your `source-directories`
639,1551455516.1752,Daysi,the elm files are in subdirectories; of these directories
639,1551455582.176,Mindy,I think you should put the whole path up to the topmost elm module
639,1551455661.1762,Daysi,that changed the error message at least :smile:; now it doesn't find a module which lives in a symlinked directory (we do translations this way by symlinking to the different language directories and building for every language); None; ..../elm/I18n is a symlink to a folder; so maybe I have to adjust the bash `find` command in `node_modules/.bin/elm make $(find app/fas_ui/src/elm/Fas/Apps -name '*.elm' -type f)`; no idea though how to  do that

641,1551460046.1831,Nana,<@Buffy> yeah I had that idea too and people told me it was bad :sweat_smile:; The benefit would be reduced boilerplate I think
641,1551460156.1835,Dorsey,"Well, IMO the readability of the code is very much reduced that way. This is of course subjective, but the impression is strong on me."

<https://ellie-app.com/4RGJFvfGbzSa1>; I’m just wondering what sorts of issues might crop up from colocating business logic and views.

641,1551460509.185,Rosalee,I like it :slightly_smiling_face:
641,1551460594.1852,Buffy,"Not sure I do… but I’d be curious to see what it looks like a little bigger…; Nice thing about MSG being a union is you can do different things based on the type, but you could still do that here…
I’m just not sure how confusing it’d be having business logic mixed in with the views…
Like the Elm compiler would still be nice to work with but I’d see business logic issues colocated with view logic issues?; I’m wondering if anyone who knew elm before like v0.16 could chime in on this, I have to imagine this sort of thing is something people would’ve already tried?"
641,1551460754.1876,Dede,"Two problems to look out for:
1) The debugger doesn't (presently) have good visibility into closures, so using them in messages or the model can make debugging harder.
2) You must be disciplined in never caching model state inside a closure as part of the update, because there can be delays from when messages are sent to when update handles them and you don't  want race conditions."
641,1551460810.1884,Buffy,Bam! :exploding_head: there it is! FTW <@Dede>!; I almost feel a bit of remorse for asking as if I might’ve brought up memories of past pains. Apologies if that’s the case.
641,1551460882.1898,Dede,"The debugger problem is just an artifact of the moment; hopefully it will go away in time.  The other one is more subtle and pernicious :wink:; I went down a similar road recently, no major pain incurred before redirecting."
641,1551460922.1908,Buffy,"And to clarify, when you say caching… are you referring to using like Html.lazy or the like?"
641,1551460931.1909,Nana,Yeah I tried something similar and encountered race conditions
641,1551460954.1914,Dede,"No, something slightly different."
641,1551460991.1916,Buffy,Wow fascinating. I wonder if either of y’all could provide an ellie example? Maybe we could start like an anti-patterns page in Elm that people could look up for answers to similar questions like this in the future?
641,1551461148.1928,Dede,"Now that I look closer, you implemented the race condition I had in mind :wink:; Imagine someone mashed the button 10 times.; So fast that all 10 happened before the first message made it to update.; The closure is referring to the external model, not to the argument m.; So you only wind up incrementing 1 time instead of 10.; `(\m -&gt; {m | count = model.count + 1}) ` should not refer to `model` but to `m` to avoid this.; If some of your closures  capture model info and are delayed until some slow http request returns, you could wind up applying really stale bits of the model, out of order, when the closures finally do run.; Does that make sense?; So an anti-pattern is certainly closing over `model` in `view`."
641,1551461912.1971,Buffy,"Man, that’s clear as a summer day! Makes perfect sense!; That’d be a super easy mistake to make… In which case giving each function their own signature ala the constructors in the Msg union eliminates that ambiguity.; Yay! More proof TEA is awesome!"

643,1551469320.2003,Angella,"In elm/time, why is `now` a `Task x Posix` and not a `Task Never Posix`?"
642,1551469642.201,Carman,"It makes it easier to combine with other tasks; A `Task x Posix` can never fail (similarly to how a `Maybe a` must be nothing and a `List a` must be empty); Taking `List a` as an example:
```
empty1 : List a
empty1 =
  []

empty2 : List Never
empty2 =
  []
```; `empty1` can more easily be combined with other types of lists. You could easily say `[1, 2, 3] ++ empty1` or `List.sum empty1`; while if you wanted to do that with `empty2` you'd have to first map the `never` function; This is the same reason Html snippets with no event handlers are usually given the type `Html a` rather than `Html Never`"
644,1551470933.2107,Angella,"It would be nice if we could write a version of Task.perform that could somehow understand that. How might that work? I guess the type would need to somehow say, ""I'll only accept something with an unspecified type parameter""? I'm trying to wrap my brain around that."
642,1551471470.2109,Carman,It does?; `Task.perform` works with `Time.now` even though it is a `Task x Posix`; See <https://ellie-app.com/4RKDqH89v4Sa1> for a live demo
645,1551477361.2144,Jarvis,"the autolocking of topics on Elm's Discourse after 10 days seems a bit aggressive. example: i just watched Dan Abrams' talk in Oslo from 1 week ago and was compelled to explore his ideas further, but couldn't post in his reference topic that's just 1 month old: <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/elm-media-control-api-proposal/3006>; another example is that i used someone's Parent-Child proposal heavily in production and i had some feedback, found the Discourse topic where they debuted it, but was unable to provide feedback because it was a couple months old."

In the 0.18 code they were encoding a list of Value (JSON ""Value"") using Encode.list [ Value, Value  etc. ].  The 0.19 version of Encode requires you to supply the encoder and list.  What encoder would be used to encode a list of JSON Value?"
645,1551479254.2243,Jarvis,"<@Pam> E.list takes (a -&gt; Value) so wouldn't identity function be sufficient?; you have List Value, so you need a function (Value -&gt; Value)"

645,1551511510.229,Jarvis,"it's one thing i like about this sort of type system. you see the signature `list : (a -&gt; Value) -&gt; List a -&gt; Value`, you know you have a List Value, so you substitute the other `a` with `Value` and see you just need a function `Value -&gt; Value`.; as opposed to shopping for a method on the datastructures that might do what you want; for some reason it took me a while to appreciate it"
647,1551521967.2316,Jae,"Hi, I'm using the elm/svg package and I want to render an image inside some svg.  I figured something like this would work
`Svg.image [ Html.Attributes.src ""image.png"", Html.Attributes.width 100, Html.Attributes.height 100 ] []` but nothing appears.  I looked at some html examples online and they seem to be including an `xlink:href=""image.png""` attribute in their image. The `Html.Attributes` module doesn't seem to have that so what do I do instead?"
645,1551522036.2323,Lynne,<@Jae> you can use `Html.Attributes.attribute` to put any arbitrary attribute
647,1551522055.2326,Jae,"Ah, I didn't notice that. Thanks!; Oh, also there is a Html.Attributes.href (not xlink:href) but when I use that I get a runtime exception with the message ""TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'href' or object '#&lt;SVGImageElement&gt;'"". Is this a known bug?"
647,1551522400.2356,Lynne,I don't know much about SVG but I can imagine that one is required putting a namespaced attribute (xlink:href) and hence setting just href may be prohibited; There is also `Svg.Attributes.xlinkHref` - that might by something you are actually after <@Jae>
647,1551522617.2368,Jae,That can't be used inside Svg.image though. Svg.image expects Html.Attributes
647,1551522748.2376,Lynne,"Both `Html.Attribute` and `Svg.Attribute` are type aliases for `VirtualDom.Attribute`, so that can't be true <@Jae>"

648,1551525923.2427,Winnie,"I'm looking for approaches to lazily populating my model based on the view. In short, one of my views needs to display the asciidoc-generated HTML from a string in my model. The natural place to request the (relatively expensive) generation is when the view actually needs it, but since generation requires sending a message out a port, the view - as far as I can tell - can't make the request. Other approaches I can think of (e.g. having my update determine when a URL change will require the generation) require putting knowledge about specific views in places besides the view. Any ideas on how I can make the generation request only when the view actually needs that data?"
649,1551526424.2431,Lynne,Do you parse URL in your `view` function now and render something depending on what you parsed? Or how does your app work currently?
648,1551526597.2433,Winnie,"yes, the URL is stored in the model and I sort out what to render in the view based on that. It's all taken pretty directly from the navigation documentation for 0.19."
649,1551526608.2435,Lynne,"I see; Well, `view` is supposed to render your model so there is basically no option to moving knowledge about specific views to it and doing URL parsing in `update` instead; I mean, if you want to request data only when it is actually needed; Why do you think it is bad if I may ask?"
649,1551526811.2443,Winnie,"Because it means that if I change my view such that asciidoc HTML is displayed in other places, I need to update the `update` function as well.; Basically, `update` needs to know specifically under which conditions the generation needs to happen."
649,1551526873.2447,Lynne,"And these conditions do not exist in URL, is it correct?"
649,1551526911.2449,Winnie,"I can examine the URL to determine if it will need the generation, but only because; but only by encoding that knowledge in `update`.; It's essentially view-specific details leaking to other parts of the program."
649,1551527014.2455,Lynne,"I understand your concern but in Elm core of program is model, not view. So what you have said about `update` is how it should be done when we are talking about the Elm architecture; In other words view is a product of model, not vice versa"
649,1551527071.2459,Winnie,"well...only because they've taken away native modules. That's how I used to do it.; Your point is true, though, so I guess my hands are tied."
649,1551527104.2463,Lynne,You may consider custom components instead if it is that critical
649,1551527146.2465,Winnie,"I wouldn't say critical. It's just frustrating that something so conceptually straightforward requires such gymnastics.; Anyhow, thanks for you help on this."
649,1551527175.2469,Lynne,You are welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
649,1551527186.2471,Winnie,"I'll look into custom components, but I imagine I'll just go the standard route."
649,1551527237.2473,Lynne,"Apart from possible inconveniences the standard way also gives some nice opportunities like displaying the ""Loading..."" screen while your picture is being rendered"
649,1551527573.2475,Winnie,Right. I wouldn't have a problem with standard approach if the view could somehow trigger the port itself. That would plug the leak.
649,1551536555.2479,Tamra,"You could always generate `Html` in `update`, store it in your `Model` and just return it in `view`. I am not sure if that is a good idea though :sweat_smile: ."
650,1551536662.2481,Lynne,It has a disadvantage of potentially doing unnecessary job as several `update` calls may happen before `view` which only happens on each animation frame
649,1551536686.2483,Lynne,"Therefore, if your model is updated often, generating Html and storing it in the model will be a waste"
651,1551540464.2499,Lynn,"what do people think is the easiest replacement for the 0.18 websockets library for a migration to 0.19? I looked at PortFunnel and it seemed to be more sophisticated (and hence more complex) to implement; I’d prefer to have the same basic api, so I can focus (at least initially) on wiring up the ports that will be needed; &lt;wishful-thinking&gt;I guess the ideal would be that someone was allowed to port the existing (native) code to 0.19 and put it on elm-explorations so that we could all use while the new version is worked on&lt;/wishful-thinking&gt;"

653,1551546981.2579,Allyn,"Hello. I wrote a parser to parse something like ” = some random text” and I need to get “some random text” from it, whatever are the characters after the “=” symbol.

This does the job, but is there a more elegant solution?"
652,1551547441.2589,Virgie,"what is inelegant to you here? it is quite understandable I think.; How do you intend to use this, the `stringParser` will just keep on chomping till the end of the input, so you can't really use this at the moment in a larger parser"
653,1551551586.2604,Allyn,I don’t need to use it in a larger parser; I was wondering if there wasn’t any shorter solution which did not imply to create the `stringParser` function
652,1551551925.262,Virgie,"you can always inline that function, but this is good code"
653,1551551989.2629,Allyn,that was definitely not what I was thinking of :wink:
652,1551551995.2632,Hoyt,Could you do something like `keep zeroOrMore `
652,1551552022.2638,Virgie,<@Hoyt> that is not part of the API any more since 0.19
652,1551552041.2645,Hoyt,"ah, okay, I”m looking at old docs. Haven’t looked at changes to the parser for 0.19"
652,1551552073.265,Virgie,"one improvement is - if you can find a character that will never occur in your code like NUL, to use `chompUntilEndOr ""\0""`; this will drop down into JS and be a little more efficient I think"
652,1551552094.2657,Hoyt,"ah, I see. Looking at the updated ones"
652,1551552346.2662,Allyn,"It does not accept “\0” as a parameter, but “\t” works"
652,1551553342.267,Virgie,"elm format rewrites `\0`  to `""\u{0000}""` which I think it should accept. anyway `\t` also does the job"
653,1551553402.2675,Allyn,"It works indeed, but I prefer “\t” for readability"

655,1551566527.2703,Verlene,`elm-use` doesn't seem to support 0.19 yet. Does anyone know why? Haven't gotten around to it yet? Is it in the works?
655,1551566708.2718,Huong,"I didn't even know that existed :smile: I tend to use `npm i` and `npx` to run project-local stuff, though there are a few tools for elm version management around, including `elmv` and various `asdf` plugins, amongst others (presumably)"

657,1551573000.2797,Allyn,Dan Abrams just made a talk about this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jW58fXuuOk>; He created a wrapper around HTML5 apis: <https://github.com/danabrams/elm-media>
656,1551595532.2805,Dorsey,"I'm thinking about a data structure for a question with single choice answer, like:

```
What is the value of 2 + 2?

  ( ) 3
  (*) 4
  ( ) 5
```

I'd like to make invalid states impossible, so the requirements are following:

1.  There must always be exactly one correct answer

    That could be satisfied with a `NonEmptyList` where the first element is the correct answer.

2.  Answers must be unique

    A Set would work, assuming there will be no additional data in the answer (like an id).

For the UX:

3.  It must be possible to re-order the options

    It's not much fun if the first option is always correct.

Best candidate I can think of so far is the `AssocList` (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/pzp1997/assoc-list/latest/>) with keys being the options and values indexes for ordering, so `AssocList.Dict Option Int`. Then to check if a given answer is correct I would test if it's the head of the `AssocList.keys`, and to render I would do `AssocList.toList &gt;&gt; sortBy Tuple.second`. The only downside I see is that the AssocList can be empty, which would violate requirement 1. I think I could live with that, but maybe I should make a `NonEmptyAssocList`. Is there anything else I should consider?"
658,1551596790.284,Krista,"Thinking about your problem, what comes to mind is that you always need a good answer and a few bad ones. So maybe you could use something like `Question String (List String)`, and then it's only a matter of displaying a random number of bad answers, then the correct answer, then the remaining bad answers?; I mean, not conflate the data and its representation"
656,1551598519.2867,Dorsey,"That would work, but I'd like the order to be explicit (i.e. not random). Also the uniqueness is not guaranteed - I'd have to check for that at runtime."
659,1551598973.2872,Cammy,"There’s a much better wrapper coming this month. ; Right now this is the way to do it but I’ll be releasing a wrapper very soon that avoids reaching into virtual dom like this. ; Why not just use a volume or muted attribute on the video dom nodes, instead of a mutation observer?"
658,1551600146.2914,Krista,Maybe `Question String Int (List String)` with the Int being the index of the correct answer?; not sure what you meant about uniqueness
658,1551601171.2932,Dorsey,"Yeah, that's interesting. Uniqueness of the answers, so that it's not possible to do ```
How much is 2 + 2

- ( ) 4
- (*) 4
- ( ) 5
```; I guess I could use `AssocSet` (it's ordered and guarantees that values are unique).; But there can still be collision between correct and one of the incorrect answers.; :thinking_face:"
658,1551601889.2987,Krista,"Ah, that is yet another concern that should maybe not be conflated with the data and its representation. Maybe the wrong answers can be manually provided, if not then you will need some kind of generation, some kind of fuzzing..."

661,1551616126.3119,Edie,"<@Dorsey> you could write a version of Selectlist can is for a Set.

663,1551617813.3187,Susanna,I'd like to insert a little elm component into an existing js/typescript/java legacy app that is build using maven and npm/grunt plugins. Grunt seems deprecated and so I don't expect the grunt-elm plugin to be maintained any further. Can anyone suggest an approach to integrating the elm build into this maven-driven (with npm and grunt plugins) project? Thanks in advance.
662,1551618607.3195,Lynne,"I am pretty sure grunt is capable of running shell commands, so you can just call `elm make` from your grunt pipeline; If you want to run it by Maven instead, there is a plugin to execute shell commands for it: <https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.codehaus.mojo/exec-maven-plugin/1.6.0/maven-plugin>; Or this one <https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/3.2.0/maven-plugin>"

664,1551622500.3223,Cammy,"You have to be very careful with your id’s doing it with querySelector. That doesn’t sound hard, but in practice, I spend a lot of time helping people with this. "
664,1551622832.3225,Cleveland,"that one of the reasons i don't want to do this with ids

because then in order to have arbitrary number of players on page i need to somehow keep track of player ids
which is much simple in js then elm i am guessing; <@Cammy> so that you are doing is for audio/video and not for DOM APIs in general right?"
664,1551623101.3243,Cammy,"Around the media playback parts of the DOM API (play, pause, etc), as well as the other media apis. ; This is what I talked about at Oslo elm day. 

Can I ask, what’s the use-case for having a lot of players on one page as opposed to one that switches sources? There’s a limit to the number of players some browsers can load on a page. ; By the way, the way I solved this in an earlier incarnation was generating an opaque type that contained the id, and using a Dict if I had multiple on the page. That was better than strings, but not 100%, at least through ports. "
664,1551626574.3291,Cleveland,"if i can't have multiple players that would mean player is singleton which is just wrong

as for examples where you need more then one player take a look at <http://coub.com|coub.com>

or this <http://tv.myvideo.ge/> this is tv streaming built with react it has main player and on the left side if you hover over some channels they have preview of stream in a mini player

in my code mini player and main player is same component with different options passed to them

screenshot <https://imgur.com/a/Ax6kOMH>"
664,1551628664.3396,Cammy,"So coub (atleast in the iOS app version) seems to only have one player at a time, which is the way something like that should work. I’ll have to take a look at how it works on a desktop browser later, but I see where this would be difficult to do with the current virtual dom implementation, but my new library should make this much easier while adhering to best practices for a good user experience, and increase performance over using 20+ individual media elements on a page. 

I’m not sure, however, that we have the necessary capabilities in Elm currently to do this properly, the way that it works in the iOS native app. I really want to see what they’re doing in a desktop browser. 

For previews, yeah, that’s a good use case, but I might suggest instead of having an arbitrary number of media elements, you only need two. The most videos that can be playing simultaneously is two: a main video and one preview at a time, assuming the previews only appear on mouseover. 

If you have 40 linked videos on the page, you don’t want to load every preview at page load, it’ll eat a ton of bandwidth, and use a ton of bandwidth. Just load the appropriate preview as you mouseover...use fMP4 and encode the previews really small, and they should load quickly. This is generally the better of the two ways I’ve seen it done on sites like YouTube (the other is image sequences). "
665,1551629340.3401,Wendell,"Any packages for manipulating the RGB values of images?; Or HSL, I guess. I’m color space agnostic."
665,1551629389.341,Cammy,You mean like making a color image black and white or something?
665,1551629420.3412,Wendell,"Sure, that’s a good example"
665,1551629558.3439,Cammy,"Don’t quote me on this, but for raw pixel manipulation, you probably need canvas. However, you can do a lot with css filters and svg filters. I suppose you could also write a jpeg or png decoder using elm/bytes, manipulate the data, then create a blob or something, but that seems nuts. "
665,1551629601.3442,Wendell,Yeah I was thinking there might be something that you can do with elm/bytes
665,1551629642.3452,Cammy,"In theory there is, and if you write a jpeg or png decoder/encoder I’ll definitely use it, but it’s a big job. ; Unless you’re just looking to glitch a random pixel, in which case you probably could do in a day with elm/bytes. "
665,1551629926.3466,Wendell,Nah I’m thinking about new ideas for packages and wanted to make sure I am not duplicating work. Now I’m going to read the png/jpeg spec to see how big a job it really is. I believe ppm is an easy format to parse but obviously it is much less useful than png/jpg. I might start there though just to see what the library would do before deciding to invest in decoding compressed images :slightly_smiling_face:.
665,1551629999.3476,Cammy,I think it’s great. I’ve been thinking about JPEG for a while but just don’t have the time. 
665,1551630015.3478,Wendell,Yeah it seems like it could be a real monster of a project.; We’ll see what my initial research yields
665,1551630104.3484,Cammy,"It would be awesome. ; If you do it, I’m sure you’ll have no problem with dct, but if you do, hit me up, I’ve done it before. "
665,1551630383.3494,Wendell,"Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind"
666,1551630773.3497,Cleveland,"mini player is constructed on mouse over and is re used when mouse moves to another channel so there is only 2 HLS players max in the application (mini/preview player and main player)
there is extra one for playing ads so that stream is pre loaded by the time ad is ended

so that's 3 players already

at some point there was an idea of having pined preview like picture in picture and to allow up to 4-5 pined previews

or there may be game with sound effects as separate mp3 files and you may need to play arbitrary number of sound tracks at same time

so of course there are reasons for not playing 40 videos at same time but that's up to application developer and there should not be limitation from language/library API"

```
FetchSettings - initiate request
ReceiveSettings(...) - handle response from above ^
UpdateSettings(...) - initiate request to update settings
ChangeSettings(...) - handle response from above ^
```
I wish naming where clearer."
675,1551702657.4011,Leonore,I always tend to name my `Msg`s after the events that happened not the other way around. Say you trigger fetching settings from a button click. Then I would name it something like `RetrieveButtonClicked`. This is also much useful when you are handling the responses. Your second `Msg` can be then called `RetrievedSettings`.

693,1551799814.4992,Shenita,the Time module is still around but it's in its own package now: `elm/time`; but for getting update msgs it only has `Time.every` (<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#every>) which gives you a subscription rather than a one-off cmd
693,1551800110.501,Karrie,I just have some html that I need remove after X seconds; so Process.sleep will work
693,1551800375.5027,Leonore,I actually played around with the extension to see what was the reason. Anyways adding `.cmd` after `elm-format` fixed the issue
694,1551802146.5046,Emilee,i've just noticed that a majority of our integration test build time comes down to installing the elm compiler from npm. is there a way to speed this up? (i'm not sure if I can get npm caching to work^^'); specifically the `binwrap-install` part
695,1551805678.5056,Marlys,Checkin the binaries ; and reference the local binary for your integration tests 
695,1551806456.5071,Huong,Write more tests :shrug:
695,1551806532.5073,Jae,"<@Huong>
I tried running your code with the following
`insertAt (-1) 'b' (Array.fromList [ 'a', 'c' ])`
and I can't understand why it returns
`[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]`
instead of
`[ 'b', 'a', 'c' ]`.
I tried it with other negative values and they all return `[ 'b', 'a', 'c' ]`."
695,1551806809.5075,Lynne,"I am not Ilias but dare to answer :slightly_smiling_face: This is due to `Array.slice` which treats negative indices as offset from the end of array.; So `before` becomes `['a']`, `after` becomes `['c']` and after pushing `'b'` it becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`"
695,1551806912.5079,Huong,"If you want `[ 'b', 'a', 'c' ]`, you'd have to `max 0 idx` or something. The main reason it behaves this way is because `slice` allows (both) indexes to be negative. so say you give it `-1`, you get `before = Array.slice 0 -1 [ 'a', 'c' ] = [ 'a' ]` and `after = Array.slice -1 2 [ 'a', 'c' ] = [ 'c' ]`; yeah, exactly that"
695,1551806968.5083,Lynne,I am sorry for jumping in :slightly_smiling_face:
695,1551806981.5085,Huong,"to put it another way, the `insertAt` I ""proposed"" should (I think) also work with negative indexes, just wrapping around the end.; I haven't tested it, tho; Nah, I liked your explanation better :shrug:; ```&gt; insertAt -2 ""item"" (Array.fromList [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"" ])
Array.fromList [""a"",""b"",""item"",""c"",""d""]
    : Array.Array String
&gt; insertAt -3 ""item"" (Array.fromList [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"" ])
Array.fromList [""a"",""item"",""b"",""c"",""d""]
    : Array.Array String```; yeah, seems to work roughly the way I think it should :smile:; (I'm _almost_ sad it doesn't `push` with `-0`)"
695,1551807321.5097,Lynne,It does push but from the LEFT side of the beginning (chuckle)
695,1551807371.5099,Huong,"Yeah, pretty much, I suppose ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

695,1551807962.5121,Niesha,I'd start by picking a parser library via <https://package.elm-lang.org/>

```

parseContent : String -&gt; List Content

696,1551808181.5144,Tawnya,The second; The second one is exactly what I need.; I have a `Parser Url`; How could I implement a function `parseMayTimes: Parser a -&gt; String -&gt; List a`?
696,1551808350.5164,Carman,You may want `Parser.loop`
696,1551808352.5166,Alicia,does it happen if you cache `node_modules` as well between builds?
695,1551808352.5168,Carman,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#loop>
696,1551808380.5173,Carman,Probably with one of the chomp functions to consume non-url strings
696,1551808433.5181,Virgie,"and `backtrackable` so you can try to parse a url, but then if the first character looks like a url but then it actually isn't, you can fall back to chomping"

711,1551907319.6064,Huong,"<@Carman> sure, when we're talking about entering your own email address, that works. Even then, it makes sense to do a sanity check first - there's no point in trying to send an email to `foobar`. Then, there are obvious misspellings, and people being rather bad at noticing their own typos.

In our specific case - and this might have something to do with our customer base - support queries went down drastically after adding stricter validation to some email input fields. Turns out, people are really sloppy, and tend to think ""the system did something wrong"" before considering they might have entered nonsense."
714,1551907456.6066,Franklin,Was that stronger validation than basically `*@*.*`?
713,1551907464.6068,Huong,"While `""hello there""@gmail` might be a valid email address according to the rfc, I _highly_ doubt that if one of our users enters that, they did it intentionally"
711,1551907706.607,Franklin,"I'd be curious to try doing validating as a warning as opposed to an error. e.g. ""That doesn't look like a valid email."" and present a link similar to ""No that's correct, that's my email"". Less validation, more... correctness-hinting? :slightly_smiling_face:"
711,1551908094.6072,Huong,"Yeah, might do that at some point. I checked our regex against the entire DB, and didn't encounter any false negatives, so I didn't want to complicate the design by adding an extra concept. But yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me, either way.

- `elm-explorations/test` cannot be an indirect dependency
In this case, it's because `noahzgordon/elm-color-extra` has it as a dependency, though I don't quite know why. If you do `elm install elm/json` and then manually remove the indirect dependency, `elm-test` is happy. However, `elm install` will always add back that indirect dependency, so to get this working consistently, `noahzgordon/elm-color-extra` would need to drop `elm/explorations` as a dependency :thinking_face:; <https://github.com/noahzgordon/elm-color-extra/pull/2> there's already an issue for it, I added a note on how this breaks stuff down the line; <@Earnestine> seems like Noah's about to release that PR, so upgrading that package in a little while should help :)"

751,1552279252.7711,Dede,"OK, here’s a more detailed shot at a permissive grammar.  This is not in a formal grammar language, it’s just an illustrative ad hoc approach.

 | whitespace whitespaceChar


plainChar = CHARS NOT IN ['\t', ' ', '/', '*']

 | plain '*' plainChar    -- handle * in middle of text
 | plain '/' plainChar    -- handle / in middle of text
 

atom =

 | bold
 | italic
 | '*'  -- handle free-standing *
 | '/'  -- handle free-standing /
 | atom whitespace atom
 | atom '*' -- handle trailing '*' with no opener -- see conflict note (1) below
 | atom '/' -- handle trailing '/' with no opener -- see conflict note (2) below


openItalic = '/' body


openBold = '*' body


body = 
 atom 
 | openItalic
 | openBold
 | body whitespace atom
 | body whitespace openItalic
 | body whitespace openBold


bold = openBold '*' -- see conflict note (1) below

italic = openItalic '/' -- see conflict note (2) below

lineContent =

-- Conflict notes
-- 
-- 1) There are conflicts in the two rules flagged by this note.  For the input ""*hello*"", 
--    one potential match is 
--
--    (bold = openBold '*') where (openBold = '*' body) where (body = atom) where (atom = plain(""hello""))
-- 
--    another potential match is
--
--    (openBold = '*' body) where (body = atom) where (atom = atom '*') where (atom = plain(""hello"")
--
--    Since we prefer the first rule, our implementation should give it precedence when both are applicable.
--
-- 2) Same exact comment as above, except for italics
```; A traditional parser generator like bison would take something like this and turn it into a state machine that could parse  the input in a non-backtracking manner.

Since this grammar is mostly simple, you can probably implement it in a fairly straightforward way translating to Elm parser.  The area I highlighted with comments is where there’s some rule ambiguity that you’ll have to specifically address.; Bison and its ilk generally look at the next “token” in the stream to decide which rule(s) could be applicable.  Even hand-coded, that approach might be profitable here.; There’s probably more ambiguities that I haven’t identified.  E.g. I think you’ll need to address what to do with “/where do the /italics start/?”; Bedtime here, I should be around on and off tomorrow.; I hope this is helpful and not (just) bloviating."
753,1552284124.7723,Carlota,"Good question!; Let's dig in.; ""Turn URLs like /blog/42/cat-herding-techniques into nice Elm data.""; That's what the `type Parser a b` type says under it."
753,1552284296.7742,Isaias,You know you've been converted when you opine the joys of functional programming to your mates in programming classes
753,1552284396.7743,Carlota,"So, you can pretty much ignore the type, I reckon.; and look at the examples.; ... if you look at the type of `parse`, which runs a parser, it becomes a bit more apparent why it's not that important: `parse : Parser (a -&gt; a) a -&gt; Url -&gt; Maybe a`; So it takes some `Parser (a -&gt; a) a` and a `Url` and gives you back a `Maybe a`. Super confusing.; If you look at the example for `parse` it's more helpful...; ... and let's take the `search` example in `&lt;/&gt;`:

```
search : Parser (String -&gt; a) a
search =
  s ""search"" &lt;/&gt; string
```; so the `Parser a b` type there is where `a` is `String -&gt; a` (different `a` tho, let's not get confused) and `b` is `a`. If we rename `Parser a b` to `Parser x y` temporarily it's easier: `Parser x y` means `x` is `String -&gt; a` and `y` is `a`.; If we look at that side by side with this:

```
type Route = Home | Blog Int | NotFound

route : Parser (Route -&gt; a) a
route =
  oneOf
    [ map Home top
    , map Blog (s ""blog"" &lt;/&gt; int)
    ]

toRoute : String -&gt; Route
toRoute string =
  case Url.fromString string of
    Nothing -&gt;
      NotFound

    Just url -&gt;
      Maybe.withDefault NotFound (parse route url)
```; ... then things start becoming clearer, coz they have a `route : (Route -&gt; a) a`... and they're using `map` to map the `Route` type's constructors over the ordinary parsers: for `Home` they're mapping over `top`, which parses nothing out, so that works coz `Home` takes no arguments. For `Blog`, which takes a single `int`, they've got `s ""blog"" &lt;/&gt; int""` which is a parser of `Parser (String -&gt; a) a` (as we saw in the example above for  `search : Parser (String -&gt; a) a` which is `s ""search"" &lt;/&gt; string`.); below, in `toRoute`, we can see they're using `parse route url` to match the function `route` as type `Parser (a -&gt; a) a`. `route` has type `Parser (Route -&gt; a) a` so that totally matches.; The thing about this Parser type is you should *actively ignore* the `a b` stuff. It's opaque, which means they don't want you to ""look inside"". Unfortunately, the pieces it exposes are necessary to make the type system able to write our actual code, so we have to have these ugly exposed type parameters.; You can think of the `a b` part of `Parser a b` as the internal parser state, though, if you like — ie what it's holding on to to do its job — which is to track all the segments of the route that have matched or not, and the functions you want to use to do the parsing with.; &gt; As a follow up, if i have a parser of type `Parser (Route -&gt; a) a` (like the one in the Url parsing guide), and i call `parse`on this parser (which has a signature of `Parser (a -&gt; a) a -&gt; Url -&gt; Maybe a)`, don't I get a `Maybe Route`? This further seems to confuse me

Yeah, that's right.; Basically, you can't see into what it's doing by trying to look at the types, which is why this is confusing from the outside.; It helps to know that a `Parser a b` in the `Url` sense combined with the `parse` function is a function from `String` to a `Maybe a`, where you decide what `a` is. It does this by keeping lists of internal state matchers. When you use the `&lt;/&gt;` function, you're combining these state matchers with a kind of `andThen` on the prior success of the previous parsers and their result succeeding.; But, IMO, it's best to just build it up by using it with examples, bit by bit until you have an intuition about how to use them.; If you want to dig into the internals, they're there... but they probably won't be *terribly* helpful to understanding how to use it. The examples are tho :slightly_smiling_face:"

Of course, it would also help to know that your websocket server, at `<ws://localhost:3000/ws/ui>` is actually getting the connection request and properly connecting. Can you add some print statements there to see what’s going on? Do you have another client, perhaps written in Node.js that can successfully connect?; It can also be useful to aim your client code at an echo server, e.g. <wss://echo.websocket.org>, or the simple JS echo server I included with the example.

You may also not have the ports configured properly. You should be able to set breakpoints in `site/js/PortFunnel/WebSocket.js` to see the commands come in, e.g. the `dispatcher` function.; And you can instrument the values coming back from the port code.

    = Text String (Set Style)

Yes, I have a Set implementation that works on `==`.
Ok, so, something like `&lt;whitespace&gt;/&lt;not-whitespace&gt;` will always add Italic to my styles. It’s not a stack, so the next `&lt;not-whitespace&gt;/&lt;whitespace&gt;` pops it off. All styles are popped off at a newline."
758,1552316820.801,Leoma,"It’s much simpler and more forgiving (I think). I’ll play with this and see how it goes.; I feel like I can more easily tokenize this with some simple regexps, then parse the output, but can I easily make elm/parser work with tokens instead of strings?"

762,1552370755.8175,Yang,"hey everyone .. an architecture question here. I keep having this need in elm to create an an object and a container of objects. I would like to keep them separate. For example i have An Exchange module.. and I want to create a container that will keep a bunch of this Exchanges in a container of some sort. It can be a list or dict or what not. In some projects i done the equivalent of `module Exchange.Container exposing(..` and in others `module Excahges` in the previous case i have the normal folder structure `/Exchange/Container.elm` and in the other one i have `/Main.elm`, `Exchange.elm` and `Exchanges.elm`

The name-spacing works but conceptually is misleading. Is like having the container of exchanges inside the Exchange.. when in fact the Exchange data structure is a child of this container.
On the other hand in big apps having all this Exchange, and Exchanges in the main folder starts feeling clunky.. there are usually many such named data structures that live in containers of some kind.
What are some good ways you people figured out to structure this conceptual parent child relation at  module level? Im thinking is possible there is no right answer but maybe someone has a nicer way of dealing with this which is better then mine.; thanks:)"
762,1552370919.8182,Earlean,"`module Exchange.Container` seems fine to me; I don't find it misleading at all, the name spacing of modules as nothing to do with how you use the values of types defined in those modules"

parseText : Styles -&gt; Parser Styled

so if parseText encounters a ` close italic/` but Italic isn’t in Styles, then it’s treated as text.

Then, if I see an openItalic, and I’m not italic, then do one of (parse openItalic, parse Styled content, parse close italics) OR (parse the open italic as text, parse styled content)"

<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis>

Not that simple...

I would not go the regexs route for performance reasons (you should test what you did on the biggest/more complex document supported by the software) and because you will have tons of edge cases that you will fix, progressively making the regexs more and more complicated, and their maintenance impossible without breaking something.

Anyway, just to show that something is possible with elm/parser:
<https://ellie-app.com/4XGvnPg32fYa1>

The rules are very strict, and therefore most likely not very practical:
• Delimiters are '/', '*' and '_' for italic, bold and underline (the '/' choice is quite risky in my opinion)
• You can nest them but if one is not closed inside another, it will be cancelled

That's it. I did not implement any space before/after things, line breaks or url handling.
You could add an url parser before every others to handle them without conflicting with the styles.
However I did not really understand what you wanted about accepting some divisions like ""5/2"" without conflicting.

The code  is a little obfuscated by the usage of `loop` to avoid stack issues (so it uses tail-call elimination),.
Anyway this is just for demo purposes, and there may be bugs. The performance should be reasonable though."

782,1552461507.9142,Earlean,What would you use this behaviour for?
781,1552461663.9165,Nga,"<@Earlean> I have a bunch of record types that define API responses. When I don't have an API response, I have it as `Maybe ApiRespObj`, but once I've received the object I transition my state from a `Maybe ApiRespObj` to just a `ApiRespObj`, so that it's easier to work with in my views. The conversion from the Maybe to the not-maybe is where I'm having a headache, because when I'm casing on my `MaybeApiRespObj` to determine whether I can convert it, if it's Nothing, I need to fall back to some zero-initd default value. It's programmed in a way that the case is never hit, but it still needs to be there because Elm needs to cover all cases."
781,1552461872.9187,Earlean,"Ah, that is a common mistake. Don't convert a Maybe to a nonsense default value. Just use `Maybe.map` etc. to work with the Maybe"
781,1552462554.9205,Nga,"Right. it's a bit of a shame because I've modeled the data in such a way that it can only ever have a correct value at that point (we have a union type that declares the state of the app, whether its Loading, Loaded, an error, etc). By using Maybe's as my Loaded values it doesn't make a lot of sense since that's not actually something that can ever happen. Not sure where this indicates the real problem is with the approach we've taken.; Or if it's just a limitation problem that we have to accept."
781,1552463932.9211,Sharon,"A `Maybe a` that can't be Nothing should just be an `a`, right?
I'm just guessing of course, but I'd look higher up if the Maybe can be avoided before giving it to the function that doesn't expect any Nothings."
781,1552464100.9224,Nga,"<@Sharon> We have something like: `{settings = Maybe ApiSettingsResponse, profile = Maybe ApiProfileResponse}`. Can't set them to just `a` because then it's the same problem again (zero initialization before the API request returns)."
783,1552464362.9236,Lynne,Settings and Profile seems like something which you get once at the very start. If that is the case it may be a good idea to postpone initialization of page/view which depends on these and only init it when you  receive them. In this case you won't need `Maybe`s.
781,1552465106.9262,Earlean,"<@Nga> so if they can't be Nothing when you're `Loaded` then that's the time to unwrap them, if any of them are Nothing then you're still in the `Loading` state"

I would disagree here. I would even say that domain modelling is one of Elm’s strengths. I agree that Elm is no silver bullet for everything, but frankly - what technology is? Saying Elm is `really ugly, verbose and unelegant` in every case that is more than a todo-app does not cross me as a fair assessment - even if it might be true for some cases."
786,1552491012.9674,Daysi,"<@Latina> as far as I understood it, type-classes enable you to define a method with the same name which does the same thing for different types. It is as if you had a utility-class in Java with only static methods which you overload for each type you want. Like for example `equals` for types String, Int, Cat, Dog ... So the program uses the correct function on runtime but gives you compile time errors if you pass e.g. `Horse` to the `equals` function because you haven't defined it yet for the `type Horse`.
Correct @ anybody?"
786,1552491119.9684,Timika,That is roughly correct. :slightly_smiling_face:; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism> describes the general concept very well IMO.

Nothing more nothing less. :slightly_smiling_face:
786,1552491427.9738,Daysi,It is not. For ToDo apps :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
786,1552491508.9752,Carman,"Elm doesn't have dependent types. Some things can't be proven by the compiler. The solution is usually to create a opaque type whose only constructor runs validations and returns a `Result`, and then fuzz-test it. While this is a run-time check, the compiler can help give you confidence that all values have been validated.; FWIW, any language that has Algebraic Data Types (e.g. Elm's custom types) is automatically in the ""modeling things elegantly"" club IMO :heart: .

786,1552491804.9846,Huong,"Honestly, we don't know enough about the domain and specific issues you're facing. Personally, depending on the domain, I think it might make sense to group conditions by how the function, and say which condition types can have what kind of conditions in them.; Something like ```type NatNumCondition
    = NatNumCompare (ComparativeCondition NatNum)

type PercentCondition
    = PercentCompate (ComparativeCondition Percent)

786,1552492455.9948,Huong,"So, I think disambiguating between the different constructors you need to accurately represent your domain logic in terms of custom types, is something you can't really get around.. _generally_. It's honestly quite amazing what you _can_ encode in the type system, but it's not always clear how to best go about that, exactly. This really does depend on what you want to _do_ with stuff!

Examples of stuff you can do with types:
- elm-css has some pretty amazing things that make it so `display none` is valid but `fontSize none` is not
- <https://gist.github.com/zwilias/ccd72ee7925b27e8c41176ebe7d33564> a balanced binary tree- you cannot construct a binary tree using those types that is NOT properly balanced
- <https://github.com/zwilias/tic-tac-toe> a game of tic tac toe where the type system guarantees quite a few semantics of the game

That said, it is not always a great idea to encode all of the semantics in your domain into the types - very often, what you need is a module whose interface encodes those semantics, while the types themselves allow some more leeway.

786,1552492620.9984,Huong,"it used to work differently. People complained, and suggested it be changed. It was changed. People complain that it works the way people suggested. :shrug:"
786,1552492640.9992,Timika,I think the change that Elm takes over ‘&lt;body&gt;’ came up a couple of times since 0.19 came out.
786,1552492654.9995,Daysi,<@Nickole> why you wanna keep it? Can you pass it via flags and keep it in the state?

786,1552493006.0038,Daysi,can you store a reference to the Element on first call to `getElementById` and use this reference later?
786,1552493042.0041,Nickole,"I tried it and I had it wrapped it the extra `div`:

786,1552493051.0043,Huong,"mostly ""redundant nesting"" and the inability to have a clean dom structure - instead, the entire app would always live inside a single `div`"

786,1552493278.0075,Nickole,"Yes, I do it exactly like this. Then I initialize Elm there but the element lose the `id` so when I want to use the `node` again, it cannott be found."
786,1552493312.0077,Daysi,why would you need id if you already have a reference to `node`?

790,1552504309.0186,Dede,"My conclusion from working with Elm parser is that you actually need two passes.  (And this isn't Elm parser's fault.)   You can reasonably use Elm parser to turn the input into a list of tokens  TEXT, WHITESPACE, OPENBOLD, OPENITALIC, CLOSEBOLD, CLOSEITALIC.  But then you need a second pass over that list, with the ability to modify it, to properly apply the tolerant markup semantics.; I think you could probably work the two phases together within the parser.  Not sure how much it's worth it.; I'm curious -- do your regexps backtrack?"
790,1552504639.0192,Leoma,"They did, but, JS regexp backtracking isn’t implemented across all major browsers. So I did a hack where I capture (pre-match)(actual-match)(post-match) then hold on to the sub-match I want."
790,1552504659.0194,Dede,Wheee.
790,1552504665.0196,Velia,"I don't think you need two passes with elm/parser, see my previous Ellie example (I just reverse all the lists after because everything is built in reverse, but this could be improved):

This is O(n) (the size of the input).

I didn't handle white spaces though, but I doubt this compromises the one pass."
790,1552504838.02,Dede,"You're targetting a simpler grammar there, I think.; Nesting isn't supposed to be permitted."
790,1552504902.0204,Leoma,I allow/support nesting like `/italic and *bold*/`
791,1552504935.0206,Dede,"Right, but you want `/hello /world/ there/` to render as
/hello _world_ there/
right?"
790,1552504950.0209,Leoma,I suspect I’m O(n^2) but with native regexp it’s plenty fast for reasonable documents.
790,1552504975.0211,Dede,"At least, that would be the most markdown-ish behavior."
790,1552505017.0213,Leoma,"So, once you “open” a style, we just look for a closing tag. So in that case the `hello /world`would be italic"

I support nesting too though."
790,1552505053.0217,Dede,"Perhaps I took markdown too literally as a target.; *this *is* markdown*; `*this *is* markdown*`; It doesn't nest.; Excuse me, it doesn't nest within a single style.; You can nest italics w/in bold and soforth.; But only the innermost opening/closing tags for a style are applied, the rest are rendered as literals.; Although looking at this Ellie, I do see much more intelligent use of andThen than I had done.; Maybe just 15 more minutes :wink:"
790,1552505233.0236,Velia,"Nesting is harder than not nesting.; And I believe <@Leoma>  wanted nesting. Anyway this was an interesting exercise, and I may need it later. It's great if you implemented what you wanted, your rules are likely more user friendly than mines."

I suspect you are O(input size^complexity of the input) , whatever that means, but this can go high and it's typical of regexs (very hard to evaluate the complexity once you have several nested ones). This might be enough for your use case though (at first, as users love to abuse features).; Anyway, what's great with SPA/Elm is that all CPU is taken from the client, so it matters a lot less than server side computing, as long as interactivity is reasonable.; Also to be fair, I may not be O(n) as I omitted the lists operations from the complexity, but this might not change much the result given the operations I do."

792,1552510470.0294,Virgie,"yea, the roadmap <https://github.com/elm/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md> is that there is no timeline"

792,1552510566.0315,Virgie,"on the other hand, it is pretty great right now, and absolutely will continue going. Not having new features and releases (that you now have to update to) every couple of months can actually be seen as a feature"

801,1552580210.0648,Lynne,"It might be not crazy at all, depending on your requirements, but imagine that data in local storage got somehow corrupted. Having your own decoder you will manage it much better than Elm would"
801,1552580239.065,Russel,"I mentioned this in <#C192T0Q1E|beginners>,
In the answer credited here, it looks like in order to support JE/JD after adding 1 union type in their model type, they need to reimplement the entire record JD/JE <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37999504/how-to-pass-union-types-through-elm-ports>; In this case, they are looking at storing their model in localStorage through ports"

801,1552581273.0757,Frieda,<@Wendy> `update` is just a function which may modify model and produce a command. Init has same power as it can modify the model and produce a command. If you want to reuse some update model logic then you can extract the logic in a helper function and use the helper function in both init and update functions.
801,1552581329.0759,Huong,"It was consciously changed in 0.19, to make it possible to pass certain things (like event data) through ports and react to those, which must (in many cases) happen synchronously"
801,1552581331.0761,Frieda,I checked the source code briefly it all it does is just pure function calls.
801,1552581368.0763,Huong,"so as far as I'm concerned, that's ""spec"", in the sense that it's not a coincidence"
801,1552581393.0765,Timika,"Yeah, same for me. Thank you for elaborating this! :slightly_smiling_face:"
803,1552583813.0769,Dede,"Agreed, that is super cool.; For what it's worth, I did one last pass and made my markdown system work entirely within the Parser operation.; There is no large-scale backtracking, although backtracking is used in tokenization.  Most of it could be squeezed out if it were a performance issue.; My completed homework assignment is here:  <https://github.com/jhbrown94/elmish-minimarkdown>; Now back to the primary project :wink:"
803,1552583944.0781,Velia,How to make two work days disappear :laughing:
803,1552583963.0783,Dede,Oh yeah.; Brainsnipe.; But I had been looking for an excuse to learn Elm Parser.
803,1552584000.0789,Velia,This will pay back I'm sure.
803,1552584005.0791,Dede,":wink:; All said and done, I think I still prefer parser-generator systems (e.g. Bison/Yacc) because the domain-specific language is so well tailored to parsing."
803,1552584031.0795,Wendy,<@Frieda> i ended up having let in init functions and gradually built the model structure. The function that was used in init model now can take model as the argument and i can refactor my code
803,1552584379.0797,Dede,(Also:  I'll bet the regexp version wins for performance because it's probably a C implementation somewhere deep inside Node.)
803,1552589070.0803,Jeanene,This ended up being v nice.
804,1552589148.0805,Jeanene,"For the purposes of validating whether somebody is 18, that constant-time check works well _enough_…and it provides a fairly clear/terse implementation IMO. Would love to know how to do it properly for leap years and whatnot, but I feel like this will check the vast majority…and if somebody fails a `is18` check, they can come back in a day or less and pass. :slightly_smiling_face:"

807,1552600023.0863,Natalie,i've been out of the elm world for a bit and it looks like `toString` is gone. what's the best way to convert a `List a` to a `String` now (assuming I can convert `a -&gt; String`)?
807,1552600166.0885,Earlean,<@Natalie> if it's for debugging purposes then `Debug.toString` is still there
807,1552600188.0896,Simon,"First map the list to a string list with that function, then look into the “join” function (either on list module or string module)"
807,1552600340.0901,Natalie,"ah yeah, somehow i missed `join`; is there any syntax like `filter (_ &gt;= 0)` in PureScript?; or is `\x -&gt; x &gt;= 0` the way to go?"
807,1552600731.092,Earlean,"Yeah, no infix partial application of operators"
808,1552608266.0949,Al,"What's the simplest way to embed working Elm code into a static webpage? For context, I am writing a blog post about elm and want working elm code in that blog post. Want something like <https://repl.it> embeds; i guess i could just compile `Browser.sandbox` for all the different examples and then embed that JS?"
809,1552614777.0961,Carlota,"Isn't there Browser.embed?; Ah, apparently not."
810,1552615339.0971,Rosaria,Hey folks. Trying to deal with nested data structures (namely updating them) and getting frustrated that `{ myRecord.data | thing = 5 }` sort of syntax isn't possible. As it seems pretty reasonable as to what that would do.; Am I missing something?; FWIW I've looked around a bit and seen the distate for deeply nested data structures. I really only have 1-2 levels max.; So I'm hoping there's a solution for not-deeply-nested-but-still-a-bit-nested.
811,1552616224.1004,Dede,"Helper functions, mostly.  E.g.
```
setThing value data = {data | thing = value}

{myRecord | data = setThing myRecord.data} 
```; Or even:
```
setThing value data = {data | thing = value}
setData data record = { record | data = data }

myRecord |&gt; setData (myRecord.data |&gt; setThing 5) 
```; Whether or not that’s an improvement is probably in the eye of the beholder."
811,1552617464.103,Rosaria,"<@Dede> I appreciate the reply. It is an improvement, but it seems so unnecessary. Wish Elm could help a bit more here."
811,1552617679.1031,Al,"I'm going to try doing a ""Literate Elm"" file"
812,1552618344.1039,Hoyt,"&gt; `{ myRecord.data | thing = 5 }`
&gt; As it seems pretty reasonable as to what that would do

This is a conversation that happens a lot. I’m always curious what you think the reasonable thing would be?
For example, what would the return value of that expression be?"
811,1552618674.1055,Rosaria,"<@Hoyt> It seems fairly obvious to me that the record would return `myRecord` as that's the main thing you're modifying. It's no different than doing:
```
let newData = { oldData | thing = 5 }
in
  { myRecord | data = newData }
```; newData is throwaway. You almost never need it and when you do you can simply break it up as above.; I'm actually curious what you think it would return. As there doesn't seem to be any other logical thing for it to return. Keep in mind too that this behavior was intuited by someone learning Elm for the first time, they thought this syntax would just work and were shocked that it didn't. Only to learn that the above code or something like it is instead necessary.; So it makes me believe more strongly that that syntax is actually the right thing to be doing."
811,1552619236.1122,Hoyt,"It seems like it could also be argued that it would return `data`, since that is what is on the left-side of `|`; I don’t have a preference either way, mostly just curious what is the “reasonable” thing different people think; The value on the left of `|` is what is updated"
811,1552619288.1134,Rosaria,"I think that if you return data it loses most of its utility.; Since if you had data, and wanted to update and return data; You would only be doing `{ data | ... }`"
811,1552619331.1147,Hoyt,"But then we have a bit of syntax dissonance. Generally { x | … } updates `x` and returns `x`; But in this case, we are updating a nested property of `x` and yet returning `x`; `{ x | attribute = newValue }`
updates `x` and returns `x`; But
` { x.prop | attribute = newValue }`
updates `prop` but returns `x`; I’m not arguing either way, just pointing out that there are different ways to lookat it"
811,1552619441.1201,Earlean,eg. `{ someRecord | data = {myRecord.data | thing = 5 }}` is also a common thing to want to be able to do
811,1552619444.1203,Hoyt,I find `{ x.prop | attribute = newValue }` to be returning `x` to be less than obvious; I like that the value on the left of `|` is what is updated and returned
811,1552619487.1214,Rosaria,The reason I find it obvious is because the value you're modifying isn't actually prop. It's the x. Which just happens to contain a prop.; You must return the thing that's modified; Which is indeed x
811,1552619515.1225,Hoyt,"I would argue that you aren’t updating `x`, you are updating the value of `prop`"
811,1552619575.1242,Rosaria,"That's simply incorrect though. Because if x isn't updated, then prop can't be updated. One is contained by the other."
811,1552619610.1249,Hoyt,":slightly_smiling_face: I could respond with you being simple incorrect :slightly_smiling_face:; One person’s “this is obvious and reasonable” is another person’s “the other thing is”; `prop` is being updated, so `prop` should be returned."
811,1552619660.1268,Rosaria,"You could, but that would also be incorrect. It's not a matter of opinion. It's just how memory of a computer works. Props memory lives as part of Xs memory. We don't have pointers in Elm."
811,1552619685.1274,Hoyt,HAHA! This compiles to javascript. The idea of “this is how memory works” is very far removed :slightly_smiling_face:
811,1552619686.1276,Rosaria,"The values are intertwined and unless explicitly separated, live together."
811,1552619692.1278,Hoyt,"I would argue that both approaches are “reasonable”; Actually, since we are working with persistent data structures, `x` doesn’t get updated at all"
811,1552619723.129,Rosaria,"Well, Elm doesn't go so far as to have a document like ""The Go memory model"" so we can't say anything about anything truly :stuck_out_tongue:"
811,1552619730.1292,Hoyt,"it has a pointer to a nested structure in memory. `x` never get changed at all; The memory locations that represent `x` don’t get touched; :slightly_smiling_face:; if you build it in a certain way; But, again, both ways are “reasonable”"
811,1552619779.1312,Rosaria,"That's also correct, but as far as Elm's concerned that wouldn't add up. Because as I said there's no pointers there. X is just a giant block of memory.; One value that gets passed around"
811,1552619818.1328,Hoyt,"It doesn’t have to be “a giant block of memory”; In any case, it is late. My point is that both expectations are perfectly reasonable."
811,1552619843.1336,Rosaria,&gt; eg. `{ someRecord | data = {myRecord.data | thing = 5 }}` is also a common thing to want to be able to do; I need to stare at this for a second.
811,1552619864.1345,Hoyt,"Also, there are design considerations that I would argue that ` { x.prop | value = newValue }` is a design issue :slightly_smiling_face:; But that’s another discussion.; I’ve built a handful of elm systems, and, to be honest, I’ve never wanted to do `{ x.prop | value = newValue }`; I generally consider that a flag that I’m missing an abstraction somewhere :slightly_smiling_face:; So I appreciate the lack of that syntax, because it helps me identify those places"
811,1552619921.1367,Rosaria,You've -never- wanted to do it? Not even once?
811,1552619924.1369,Hoyt,nope
811,1552619930.1373,Rosaria,I can't imagine that.; My models are relatively flat. They at most have 1 level deep.; But it's quite often a necessity.
811,1552619958.1388,Hoyt,I like to have 1- to 2-level nesting
811,1552619968.1392,Rosaria,Why I would build a bunch of helper functions to deal with setting those nested values is beyond me; To me it doesn't say I'm missing an abstraction; It just represents extra work
811,1552619996.1407,Hoyt,And I would say that both opinions are reasonable; My functions for updating the nested properties generally come about because I have an abstraction that represents updating those
811,1552620027.1421,Rosaria,"I find it hard to believe that if the syntax didn't exist since Elm's inception, that you would have avoided it in favor of ""abstractions""."
811,1552620035.1423,Hoyt,"That’s okay; It is perfectly fine to find it hard to believe; Because the way you design thing is almost assuredly perfectly reasonable, as well :slightly_smiling_face:"
811,1552620082.1436,Rosaria,"Well it's not, because I'm forced to make all these helper functions that aren't helpful; It's irony :disappointed:"
811,1552620101.1442,Hoyt,"Ah, then maybe not. :slightly_smiling_face:"
811,1552620150.1461,Rosaria,"I don't feel like I'm missing any abstraction or anything. I have a model for my page, and a response object that comes from the server.; I put the response in the model; And then want to update it at some point; And my problem exists right away.; It's not a complicated problem.; Simply one that I have no tools to solve succintly."
811,1552620198.1489,Hoyt,Maybe direct mapping the server response to a nested record w/o an abstraction is something to think about
811,1552620224.1496,Rosaria,"The server objects are used bidirectionally. It simplifies a lot of things. Tearing apart would only mean more code to put it back together.; If I want to update that object, I change a part of it and send it back.; Hence needing to update nested objects."
811,1552620254.1505,Hoyt,"That’s what encoder/decoder pairs are for; Perhaps decoding it on the download into something appropriate, then encoding it back to the wire protocol; But, again, I don’t know your situation, so I can’t say what you should do"
811,1552620291.152,Rosaria,I'm already doing that.; But; The key is that the server response/request objects are generated code; So modifying them or assimilating them into a completely flattened model isn't really feasible.; Nor desirable.
811,1552620331.1536,Hoyt,ok
811,1552620358.1542,Rosaria,"They serialize back and forth, and encompass all the types the server understands.; It's a very nice model tbh."
811,1552620365.1546,Hoyt,I believe it
811,1552620376.155,Rosaria,But when you go to update these objects inside your model; One of your eyes always twitches a few times
811,1552620391.1556,Hoyt,:slightly_smiling_face: your = my :slightly_smiling_face:; Different designs are optimized for different situations
811,1552620488.1578,Rosaria,Can I ask how you handle the problem for your own stuff?; You've mentioned abstractions; But that's fairly abstract.
811,1552620512.1589,Hoyt,"I generally have a module representing working with whatever the nested value represents; If I find I need to update it, then I generally find I need to do other things with it; So, I usually end up with (and, of course, specific context matters); ```
{ model | prop = Abstraction.doSomethingWith model.prop }
```; There is usually a reason I’m updating a specific aspect of the nested structure. I try to map the update to that reason; But, again, very abstract explanation and it always comes down to the specific context of the codebase"
811,1552620611.1618,Rosaria,Right.
811,1552620618.1621,Hoyt,"So, there isn’t a “one size fits all”; but I will say that I don’t find myself needing `{ model.prop | attribute = newValue }`; Because my module’s “doSomethingWith” receives the `prop` and updates it; So, I don’t need the nested syntax; I try to build in terms of the behaviours, rather than the data, so I generally find myself with these functions; I’m sure there are impacts of this style in other aspects; that perhaps over-complicate things in other parts of my system. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So many trade-offs"
811,1552620744.1666,Rosaria,Always is in programming.
811,1552620748.1668,Hoyt,"for sure; Why I always try to say “there’s no best design, only better design for the context”"
811,1552620827.1683,Rosaria,"It's generated code, so we could generate the helpers as well.; It just seems like such a waste; Adding potentially thousands of helper functions, most of which would never be used"
811,1552620851.1693,Hoyt,"There are some utilities that generate the nested helpers, for sure"
811,1552620854.1696,Rosaria,Add compile times etc.
811,1552620864.17,Hoyt,Luckily we won’t compile in the functions that aren’t used
811,1552620885.1704,Rosaria,Does 0.19 do DCE?; My memory is fuzzy on that.
811,1552620899.1709,Hoyt,yeah
811,1552620902.1711,Rosaria,I see.
811,1552620908.1716,Hoyt,(as per my understanding)
811,1552620935.1719,Earlean,"yep, function and type level DCE"
811,1552620993.1725,Hoyt,"In any case, thanks <@Rosaria> for the chat. I’m a bit drunk and ready for bed. :slightly_smiling_face:; I’m always intrigued by people’s thoughts on these things; I appreciate your explaining where youa re coming from"
811,1552621081.1741,Rosaria,I'll probably gather a bunch of data and attempt to write a proposal on the Discourse. There's certainly enough data pointing to this as a problem. But unlike the verbosity of JSON decoders this one seems solvable to me.; Also thanks for the counter-example <@Earlean>
811,1552621109.175,Hoyt,"awesome. I’ll be interested in reading it.; There is definitely value in “I design this way, because this is the facility I have”"
811,1552621158.1768,Earlean,It's been something that has been discussed for a few years now and Evan doesn't seem interested in changing it
811,1552621160.1769,Hoyt,"Or, rather, “definitely something there”; I like hearing people’s thoughts on it"
811,1552621183.1783,Rosaria,"<@Earlean> Ahh, the benevolent dictator. Only so benevolent I suppose."
811,1552621192.1787,Hoyt,"It often boils down to people’s design philosophies, so I like hearing them.; Whether it is leading to a change or not"
811,1552621214.1795,Earlean,`{myRecord.data | field = value}` (where it returns `data`) not working was originally considered a bug in the compiler
811,1552621221.1797,Rosaria,"<@Hoyt> I like these sorts of discussions too, as a kind of language nerd myself."
811,1552621244.1802,Earlean,and was not fixed because it was considered that code doing that was worse code
811,1552621280.1808,Rosaria,<@Earlean> And how about code that's returning `myRecord` instead? Does that make it better? :smile:
811,1552621378.1825,Earlean,"it was generally considered to be a bit of a confusing thing to do `{myrecord | ...}` updates `myrecord`, but `{myRecord.data| }` doesn't update `data`, that's weird..."
813,1552621413.1831,Earlean,should `{(someFunction someValue) | field = value}`  work?
811,1552621434.1836,Earlean,"if so, what part of the value does the update apply to?; do we need some other different syntax for when I want to update `myRecord.data` without first assigning `myRecord.data` to a variable in a `let`?; if Elm supports both cases then won't people get them confused"
813,1552621556.186,Ruthann,"just latching on to the last part of the convo, i would love to see a setter syntax just like how we currently have the getter `.` syntax"
811,1552621796.1883,Rosaria,<@Ruthann> I think everyone would love that :stuck_out_tongue:
813,1552621831.1889,Earlean,"```
setData: a -&gt; {b | data: a} -&gt; b
setData a b = {b | data = a}

(setData someData myRecord)
```"
811,1552621874.1899,Rosaria,"<@Earlean> But it does update `data`. But immediately it assigns that to `myRecord.data` as it's specified there in the update statement. But it returns `myRecord` because ultimately you have modified that. And if you do not return that, you've lost part of your update.; Also I would think that `{(someFunction someValue) | field = value}` is outside of the scope of this conversation"
811,1552621954.1915,Earlean,"<@Rosaria> yeah, but why should it do that? I passed the `data` value to it, why should it care about `myRecord`?"
811,1552621975.1919,Rosaria,<@Earlean> You passed `myRecord's` `.data` to it. Therefore it must care.
813,1552622006.1927,Rosaria,It depends how you perceive the `{ | }` syntax I suppose.
813,1552622035.1936,Earlean,"```
let
  data = myRecord.data
in
  {data | field = value}

^ data is the same value there"
811,1552622035.1937,Rosaria,"To me I find it a magical beast that defies the very nature of Elm. It barely has a place in the language. It works with almost no constructs that work everywhere else in Elm.; Right, but at that point you're only passing data; And it would only return data; And if you wanted it to behave that way, that's the code you would write.; I believe that that use case is far less used (though I'd have to get the data to prove that)"
811,1552622085.1957,Earlean,what if I wanted the above behaviour? would I have to do the `let..in`?
811,1552622096.196,Rosaria,Yep. As you have to do now.; Since no `.` is accepted anywhere in the record update syntax.
811,1552622121.1966,Earlean,so why one behaviour instead of the other?
811,1552622139.197,Rosaria,"&gt; I believe that that use case is far less used (though I'd have to get the data to prove that); I'd actually like to see the data; I wonder if it's possible to comb some elm repositories; Looking for these exact patterns; And produce meaningful statistics on it.; I'd additionally say that, it's harder to do the opposite if you want it. Consider the two use cases:
```
-- Update nested data
let data = myRecord.data
      newData = { data | thing = 5 }
in { myRecord | data = newData }

-- Update nested data without updating each level of nest
let
  data = myRecord.data
in
  {data | field = value}

  data = myRecord.data

811,1552622483.2032,Earlean,"3 levels deep and I'd agree, but at that point you're writing worse code"
811,1552622527.2039,Rosaria,"Perhaps. Perhaps not. Sometimes it might not even be something you wrote!; But regardless, those are the reasons that I'd choose one return over the other.; I think one has genuinely more impact and utility.; Whereas the other is less frequently used and easier to deal with when it does arise; And I'm happy to have someone call me out for a lack of data on that; It's just my anecdotes."
811,1552622579.2058,Earlean,It's also one of those things where it's not a lot of code..but if it is then you write a function and use that function
811,1552622605.2061,Rosaria,But it's a trivial function. It's not something deserving of your time.; It doesn't enhance readability particularly.; It doesn't add value.; It just exists.; And detracts from the real problem you're trying to solve.
811,1552622676.2076,Earlean,it usefully names the change you're making to `data`
811,1552622707.2082,Rosaria,There's nothing hidden in the syntax I'm proposing. It also usefully displays exactly what is occurring.; Without having to have a collection of helper functions in the file / in a separate file relating to that type.; Whether or not having a name is useful I think is fairly debatable.
811,1552622749.2098,Earlean,"it displays what field you're updating, but doesn't explain why"
811,1552622753.21,Rosaria,"Because the `=` says quite a lot about what's occurring.; I'd say that the setter displays equal amounts of what, but no why at all.; Neither explains the reason behind the change; Simply that it's occurring."
811,1552622847.2124,Earlean,assumably the why of your update to `data` is explained in a function name of a function for `myRecord`
811,1552622860.2127,Rosaria,"Let's take an example: `setAge`; Just a generic, boring assignment setter.; No reasoning; No why.; It just sets a value to be equal to another."
811,1552622895.214,Earlean,"`setAge` isn't a good example, `age` is not a complex data structure; there isn't any nesting in `age`"
811,1552622912.2148,Rosaria,"You're right, but that's the setter for the more complex data structure of `user`.; ```setAge user 5```; Remember that this is the other side of the evil for a nested record update.; My model contains a user object, it needs its age updated as the user has dictated; There's nothing fancy about it; Just an integer needs to be set.; But this is a real use case.; Thanks for the chat <@Earlean>. Nice to bounce ideas around. I'm going to do some other things. Have a good night/day wherever you are :slightly_smiling_face:"
814,1552623838.2195,Dede,I acknowledge that {foo.bar | baz = 5 } is kind of confusing in terms of whether it returns modified-foo or modified-bar.  I wonder if a new syntax could solve this.  Has anyone looked at something like ```{foo | bar | baz = 5}``` ?; I feel like the problem is that imperative programmers have assumptions about what happens if you say `foo.bar.baz = 5` because it just mutated baz in place.  New syntax could avoid preconceptions.
814,1552623936.2212,Nga,was there a problem with ```{data | object = { object | thing = 5 }}``` ? That seems like it could be a reasonable alternative too.
814,1552623986.2218,Dede,"You have weird namespace stuff there, because in current code the first and second usage of `object` refer to different things.; The second one refers to `object` in the containing scope.  (So I guess my point is what you wrote has pre-existing semantics that it would be confusing to change.)"
811,1552624173.2246,Nga,"Fair enough. I'd love to see Aaron's example or yours, or something like it make its way in. Googling the issue there's no shortage of people trying to work around this."
814,1552627046.2259,Ruthann,"&gt; That seems like it could be a reasonable alternative too.

you also have to declare the second ‘object’ as a variable, either through destructuring it or in a let block. it get verbose quickly when setting records, not so when getting them. `data.object.thing`"
815,1552640325.2273,Rubi,"Hello, is there a method like next for types ? Like if I have type Color = Green | Red | Yellow, and I have Green, the next would be Red"

815,1552640442.2286,Rubi,"Thank you <@Lynne>, I'll just implement a custom one."
816,1552642195.2295,Jarod,"Hi. I have a design question:
I have a type which looks like this...; now I have a constructor function `fromValue`
, which takes a AmountCondition and a String. It then determines if the string should be parsed as a Percent or an Amount.; So far so good.; But now I have to pass a `type Currency = EUR | USD` to construct an `Amount`.; I want to pass the currency to the constructor function `fromValue` _only_ if needed. How can I do that?; ```
type Currency
    = EUR
    | USD


type Amount
    = Amount Currency Float


amount : Currency -&gt; Float -&gt; Amount
amount currency float =
    Amount currency float


amountFromStr : Currency -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe Amount
amountFromStr currency string =
    Maybe.map (amount currency) (String.toFloat string)

```; ```
type Percent
    = Percent Int


percentFromStr : String -&gt; Maybe Percent
percentFromStr str =
    Maybe.map percent (String.toInt str)
```; so only the `amountFromStr` function needs one extra argument `Currency` but not the `percentFromStr` function.; Any ideas?; The trickiness lies in that the `type AmountCondition` can hold one of two types of values: an amount or a percentage.; we have one function, which can construct a `AmountCondition` which uses the constructors of an amount or an percentage.
The constructor for `Amount` needs one additional argument: a currency. But only the main program knows the concrete currency. The `module AmountCondition` is unaware of what particular currency is used at runtime.; the main program only _uses_ `module AmountCondition`."

816,1552648082.239,Bert,Thanks! So your problem was that you always need a Currency for the `conditionFromValue` function?
816,1552648325.2392,Jarod,"yup! I need to pass a Currency to every function that might or might not output something with an `Amount`; Though this is possible, I search for a more elegant solution. It is a design question I think... Maybe you have an idea?"
818,1552648821.2396,Lynne,"Why was `AmountCondition` defined this way? Right now it contains variants which are not mutually exclusive. For example, `GreaterThan` and `IncreasedByPercent` will be true at the same time. It makes me thinking that you could benefit from changing design if the modeling was different.; Long story short, which problem are you solving by having `AmountCondition`?"
818,1552649106.2401,Jarod,"well, this would make a short story actually long. In the real app I have two other `Condition` types like `AmountCondition`.
How do you mean ""`GreaterThan` and `IncreasedByPercent` will be true at the same time.""? They are mutually exclusive..."
818,1552649141.2403,Lynne,"If a value is greater than another value by some percent, it is also just greater than that value :slightly_smiling_face:; Like 3 is 2 increased by 50% and 3 is greater than 2 - both statements are true"

818,1552649244.2417,Jarod,yes :despair:; ._.
818,1552649256.2421,Lynne,"Ok, but then just pass currency always; It is hard to do something more elegant than that given you are restricted by API"
818,1552649290.2425,Jarod,yep. I think this is the best alternative :disappointed: ugly but explicit and stupid (KISS)

*Custom Types* from ELM VS *Enums* from Java

Hi!

Reading the appendix* from the guide I did not really find there is a difference in terms of cardinality between a custom type from ELM and an Enum from Java. Both will give no room for invalid inputs. I agree it is easier to create a custom type though.

What are your thoughts on this guys?

* Source:
<https://guide.elm-lang.org/appendix/types_as_sets.html>

Thank you!"
849,1552959259.3527,Ruthann,"i can't remember if java enums are simple Ints, if so then there's one difference, a custom type can hold state or other custom types.

however the biggest difference is the handling of custom types by the compiler. Elm will fail to compile if in a case statement, you do not handle all cases of a custom type. I believe java does not do this? ( sorry, no longer program in java )"
849,1552960019.3542,Dede,"IIRC, under the hood, each value in a Java Enum is just a singleton object.  They can’t carry data because they’re all constructed at startup.  And the type checking definitely isn’t detailed enough to ensure comprehensive switch coverage.; Like so much of Java, it’s really just syntactic sugar on objects."
849,1552960197.3557,Shondra,"I wish, under the hood they are just Ints, if they were proper objects maybe they could carry some state"
849,1552960461.3567,Dede,"Hilariously, they are objects, and they can carry methods, and they can even carry the data with which they are constructed.  Just.. .construction only happens once, so that comparison is just object comparison.; <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html>"

853,1552998398.3724,Nana,bug fixes ought to be treated differently than features though?
853,1552999072.373,Virgie,the fix here is simple (do not use `--debug`) and therefore it did not warrant a patch release (so far); the debug mode needs a lot of work anyway so patching it up now (while it is not  really that useful) doesn't make sense
853,1553000206.3775,Maida,<@Virgie> I use the debugger extensively. Moving to `0.19` I had a significant drop in the quality of my debugging. Up until last week I used a fork that solved some of the issues with `Map.!:` but that fork stopped working too.

854,1553001639.3794,Todd,hey everyone! I work on an enterprise project using Elm and it has a pretty large codebase; build times have become pretty unhealthy over time and I was wondering if some of you could share your build times (without previous build cache) and approx. lines of code? I'm interested to see if ours is a unique issue
854,1553001718.3809,Earlean,<@Todd> are you on Elm 0.19?
854,1553001747.3814,Todd,"not yet, but I can't imagine the difference between the two versions to be that critically huge, especially with larger codebases"
854,1553001779.382,Earlean,It's quite a huge difference
854,1553001797.3823,Nana,I heard it can be around 40x? :smile:
854,1553001850.3833,Earlean,0.18 has some pathologic cases with n^2 complex; If compile time is your biggest concern then moving to 0.19 should be a high priority. 
854,1553002057.3854,Todd,"it is a high priority, but we also suspect that there are problems coming from modules that have too many dependencies/dependents; I also wanted to see what kind of experiences others have with big codebases"
854,1553002319.3902,Earlean,In terms of relationships between modules you want to structure your app so that modules that change often have few modules dependent on them because all modules that depend on a changed module need recompiling; A common mistake is to make too many modules depedent on a module that changes often. Eg. A shared Msg or Model module imported by every other module
854,1553002450.3939,Todd,"Yes, we recently realized how much of a problem this has become. When our codebase was small, it was not a big deal, but it quickly snowballed and we didn't even notice"
854,1553002520.395,Earlean,Or putting modules containing views/css (that designers are changing often)  at the very bottom of a dependency chain of modules
854,1553002630.3965,Huong,"as a datapoint, our codebase went from 8 minutes -&gt; 12 seconds; (for a clean compile, that is)"
854,1553002762.3969,Todd,how large is this codebase?? :anguished:

861,1553018506.4076,Dede,Hm.  Can you provide more detail?
860,1553019106.4078,Rosaria,On init API requests fly out on a given page. If one comes back 401 then we redirect the user to a 404 page with the ability to login there. But a second in flight request triggers the same thing and we get redirected a second time.

860,1553019719.4082,Rosaria,"Open to suggestions. It's not so much a route as it's a global message that is handled in Main, it's handled with a redirect in Main however."
860,1553019760.4084,Nana,"nicer to just have it as a conditonal view - ie. if current route requires auth and auth is missing, display login screen. if auth is pending, display a loading indicator, if everything is fine, display the actual page"

860,1553020221.409,Rosaria,"I'll consider that. Thanks :smile:; Ah, although there is a problem with that. We don't duplicate our authentication logic on the client side.; We just let the server throw 401s back at us when the user needs to be authed and so we know.; Will have to look at other workarounds :disappointed:"
863,1553023391.41,Marlys,Is it possible to perform a Task ignoring failure cases?
863,1553023503.4104,Virgie,"performing a task must fire a message, but you can ignore that message; but I don't think a `Task SomeError a -&gt; Task Never a` exists"
863,1553023538.4112,Marlys,Hmm ok
863,1553023570.4114,Kris,You can ; Use `mapError boom` to get a `Task Never something` and then use perform ; `boom x = boom x`; It crashes your app if the task fails though 
863,1553023687.4138,Marlys,"yea, that's not what I want :smile:"
863,1553023888.4139,Dede,"Thought:  keep an `epoch` number in your model.  You increment it whenever something happens that invalidates outstanding messages, e.g. a completed redirect.  You embed it in every message associated with an outstanding request.  When you receive a completed request response if the embedded epoch doesn’t match `model.epoch` you don’t act on it.  It’s easier than putting a UID on every outstanding request and less subject to weird races."
863,1553024268.4141,Rosaria,"Also an interesting suggestion.; I'll consider that a bit more, thanks for your efforts guys."

This is presuming you have a way to distinguish the first request on a specific Msg; And assuming a valid session will stay alive during the time between receiving the first response and the other requests hitting the server, which seems reasonable"

865,1553039769.4269,Ruthann,you can declare `_` as the variable for more than one expression if that helps

Case statements are exhaustive on the input type but not on the output type. What if we had the possibilty to specify that we expect the output of a case statement to cover all possibilities of a type. Would something like that even be possible and would you find it useful?"
865,1553039876.4296,Jacquelyn,"`square` wouldn’t square any arguments though. It would take 2 arguments, just like `^`"

865,1553039905.4301,Jacquelyn,Does Elm not have a `flip` function?

865,1553039913.4305,Ruthann,used to in 0.18
865,1553039922.4307,Jacquelyn,I could do `flip (^) 2` if it did; `flip` was removed?
865,1553039949.4311,Kymberly,and a few other functions that were just too easy to write as an anonymous function.; decrease clutter i guess - but they might exist in the elm-extras packages
865,1553039976.4315,Jacquelyn,"ok, so <@Kymberly> looks like you’re right, `\n -&gt; n^2` is the way to go…"
865,1553040057.4329,Kymberly,<https://github.com/elm-community/basics-extra> has the `flip` function
865,1553040075.4338,Ruthann,that’s a very interesting case ( mind the pun ) and i would definitely find it useful for decoding our backend enums which comes as strings into custom types
865,1553040077.434,Kymberly,(fixed link)
865,1553040096.4347,Ruthann,"instead now we have console errors and when i get them, the errors point me to the right file to update the enums; i mean i’ve used flip before:
```
sqr = flip (^) 2

but it seems a lot clearer to just write
```
sqr x = x ^ 2

865,1553040217.437,Nancy,"one case I would find useful would be in context to extracting part of a custom type, ie.

aIndex a =

865,1553040336.4409,Jillian,Well the syntax would probably not be straight forward as you need to be able specify which type exactly you would like to cover exhaustively. Eg if your are doing String -&gt; Result Html.Error MyType you would not want to cover all possible cases of Html.Error but maybe MyType
865,1553040347.4411,Nancy,"another case would be functions like `List.indexedMap (\_index value -&gt; value)` - I know this is not a good example given that `List.map` exists, but just to represent the use case; tools like elm-analyse would still warn about this"
865,1553040438.4415,Jillian,But maybe they are open to respecting this in the future
865,1553040531.4417,Ruthann,"ah hehe, can’t help you there.
the way i think about it, Elm gives you the ability to name variables you care about, and `_` to name any numbers of variables you don’t care about for destructuring. Your requirement is somewhat ambiguous, do you care about _count or not? if yes just name it `count`, if not, then `_`."

865,1553040735.4421,Ruthann,"actually, i realise the way to do this is to write the reverse function first `MyType -&gt; String` then use that in reverse  to resolve the string ( by manually listing out all values of MyType or just having it as a compile time flag )"
865,1553040827.4423,Jacquelyn,"definitely `sqr x = x ^ 2` is nicer. However, I wanted to write this inline: `map (flip (^) 2) myList` vs `map (\n -&gt; n ^ 2) myList`. There, I like `flip` slightly more. Not a big deal though. More a curiosity about Elm syntax."
865,1553041289.4425,Earlean,if you want `flip` you can easily write it
866,1553066722.4428,Bert,"Removing backticks, flip, custom operators etc. all contribute to the fact that people who know the concepts of Elm can truly read and understand anyone's code ; The lack of type classes and qualified imports by default help a lot too, I think: the types are very explicit everywhere in typical Elm code. You can't confuse `Maybe` with `Task` in any way. As a Haskell beginner, I often get confused when dealing with e.g. `IO (Maybe String)`. "

I already:
- set http_proxy and https_proxy
- set up the root certificate (this was needed to let npm work properly)
I also tried to debug the connection using node
```const caw = require('caw');
const got = require('got');
got('<http://packages.elm-lang.org|packages.elm-lang.org>', { agent: caw() }, ()=&gt; {});
```
the result was
```(node:17607) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: RequestError: tunneling socket could not be established, statusCode=502```
so looks like a problem with the firewall setup
Any suggestion? Thanks a lot in advance

EDIT:
looks like the ""caw"" package can't properly tunnel our corporate proxy.
or at least I can't configure node to work properly"
867,1553089061.451,Chaya,"I have a best practice-question: How do you handle cases where based upon something in the model you should either show something or nothing. This applies to for example error messages.

I often end up with something like this:

                showErrorMessage

I don't want to give one more credit than the other. I'm not sure which came first.

&gt; Williams: No, Rust 100% borrowed from Elm. We copied them shamelessly and we thank them daily.

&gt; Phelps: I thought so, but I didn't want to say it.

&gt; Williams: It's true.

&gt; Phelps: But Elm, in hindsight, it's kind of like, “Duh”. But essentially, Elm, this programming language that was designed for the web, it's kind of like a gateway drug to Haskell, but yes, but it's much much simpler. Sorry about the drug metaphor, I guess.

&gt; Williams: It's cool. It's like hurting cats up here.

&gt; Phelps: I know it. But anyway, it did something novel that is laughable, but that it actually gave us real good air messages. It actually did not only give you a short description that you could google, but also a long description that a human would read, and pointed you exactly to the line of code and in a lot of cases, gave you examples of what you should probably do, what it thinks you meant or what you might want to put here instead. And that was a number of years ago when it first did that. If you're fairly new to programming, you might not have noticed because in the last many years, four or five years, other languages have borrowed from that philosophy. And I just think that that's a huge thing. It really set the bar just totally different. And it's funny, because if you write a lot of Javascript, you still to this day get undefined is not a function errors."

875,1553175050.4968,Caron,Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
875,1553175096.4969,Dede,"As another example, I’ll point you at <https://github.com/jhbrown94/experimental-elm-spa-skeleton/blob/master/src/Route.elm> and <https://github.com/jhbrown94/experimental-elm-spa-skeleton/blob/master/src/Router.elm>

This approach makes a distinction between Route (the parsed URL) and the Page you end up on (which could vary due to, e.g., authentication.)   It’s a work in progress so I’d caution careful consideration before totally cloning it, but maybe looking at it will help clarify how things work generally…?"
875,1553175299.4988,Caron,"I'm not sure that's what I needed, but maybe my initial message was not clear.
What I'm looking for is a lib that wraps a type of data and lets you store that type of data from different origins, in order to avoid data duplication and automate gc for the store."
875,1553175353.4994,Agustin,What your use case? I mean implementing that is non trivial and the cost of downloading the library would probably outweigh the benefit in most cases…
875,1553176888.5005,Caron,"we load the same data for separate reasons, and need a single storage to make sure that modified data is correctly modified in each use case; for reasons unrelated we don't want data to be pushed from the server, so we can't just make a roundtrip with the backend to update data."
877,1553177701.5076,Shenita,normalised data &amp; garbage collection is a bit of a pain with the elm architecture (or redux); logic for what data is in use is probably highly specific to your app and very brittle; probs best just denormalising in a sensible way if memory usage is an issue?
878,1553178404.5103,Alicia,"we do something similar with ports, we send updates out to localstorage, store it, and send the new state back into Elm.  Inside elm it is a read-only cache that we can look things up in, to modify it you have to go out a port.  You can also avoid localstorage if you want and just keep an in-memory cache in Elm that you pass around; we put it in our `Session` model that was passed everywhere"
879,1553179261.5147,Caron,"&gt; logic for what data is in use is probably highly specific to your app and very brittle
The general logic is complex, but what it's really is a set of rules and each is simple.
For instance, say we store meetings. Some meetings are not scheduled.
So one rule would be to say that the meetings scheduled this month are in the store, a second rule would be to say that all the unscheduled meetings created recently are in the store, and a third rule would be that the last 3 meetings returned by the search module are in store.
In a read model, you can completely separate these 3 requirements, but as soon as you write, the last search result may be modified from the monthly planning. So we need one store representation.; The idea for such a store would be to say that you have a `Store Meeting` to which you can add rules saying what data is appropriate in the store, and what data is relevant to a given rule (e.g. ask the store all the meetings that are in the month). Also you could modify any data in the store without caring about where it is from...; I had the wild hope that one such lib existed, but I'll code it myself otherwise :slightly_smiling_face:"
879,1553180543.5191,Shenita,"ah ok, that sounds like a good approach; if you were to have highly relational data though I think that's where you would run into trouble"
880,1553181735.5248,Elina,"hi all! question for everyone. I watched Evan's ""The Life of a File"" talk two years ago and certainly agree with his premise of building files around a type, its API, and related helper functions, and not trying to keep files artificially short. however, I work on a large Elm codebase and I'm curious about the practical upper limits of file length. how long is too long, and what do you think is practical? do you think code should only be modularized when reuse is a goal?"
880,1553182231.5282,Dayna,"<@Elina> I like small single purpose files, for example for a Page I have a `Model.elm, Update.elm, View.elm, Api.elm` etc, unfortunately Elm doesn't allow circular references, so this style of separating your files in almost impossible and you're forced to group things together."

882,1553184412.5291,Maida,too long might have more to do with code complexity than with the actual lines of code.; some code just takes a lot of vertical space but it is simple code.
882,1553184432.5295,Elina,i've run into that too. we approach it by making Api the file that doesn't import from the others
882,1553184499.5297,Maida,"when implementing an webapp, I like to keep all the code belonging to a page in a single file. The largest I have in my largest app is a little bit over 1k lines."
882,1553184648.5299,Elina,"totally. we're considering a similar approach on the team i'm on, but some of our page files would be over 6k lines if we did it. so i'm curious what the tradeoffs are, and whether my hesitation to make files that long is actually justified or not"
882,1553184665.5301,Maida,"with this approach in mind I then proceed in extracting code based on domain. I like to keep the Business Objects each in their own module in a `Data` folder. These modules implement a lot of things related to the module’s object like Json Decoding and Encoding, queries and mutations for things that might be too complex.; then there is a module that captures most of the interaction with the backend, this is where queries are defined. Most functions take a message creator the credentials and produce a Cmd.; there is also a folder with all sorts of helpers. Things that should be in some `elm-community/*-extra` kind of a package.; and then there is the `Widgets` folder that holds complex widgets that I feel are complex enough to warrant their own module. For example, an autocomplete  widget or the sidebar (which has some interactivity).; If a page has a complex enough subpart, I also create a folder with the name of that page and extract the complex part into its own module. e.g. I have `Pages.Foo` and `Pages.Foo.Subfoo`"
882,1553184984.5311,Elina,<@Maida> it's like you're describing our codebase—so similar it's scary!
882,1553185002.5313,Maida,This is similar to how `elm-spa-example` used to be structured; I expect that a lot of codebases somehow end up in this kind of a structure.

Now it seems a lot like I have to write two functions not to mention that Task path does not offer json decoding by default from what I can tell.; I am aware there is a package `remotedata-http` that seems to be helping with that; just being curious about the design reasons; previous API seemed flexible and nice; new one...it's not IMHO"

I could see converting HTML to Elm for a static page, but adding animations and interactivity will blur the line between design and development, how would a designer add something like a fade-out effect when a panel closes? It would likely require some changes in Elm state to keep the component around in the DOM until the animation finishes; if you haven’t seen it check out <https://zeplin.io/> <@Dede>, it is like the old photoshop mocks on steroids, you can measure things, see colors, generated CSS, and a lot more"

903,1553284330.5809,Alicia,"depends on your situation, on a smaller team I don’t think it is so bad; in a larger organization I would consider it a sign of poor organization, presumably your developers are better at development than the designers, and the designers are better at designing things than the developers.  Having them trade jobs would be inefficient for both"

909,1553342686.5947,Virgie,well trying to make anything do something it wasn't designed for is going to be ugly

909,1553342985.5969,Virgie,"no, `type L a = N | S a (L a)` is possible, because `L a` is of kind `*`"

909,1553343301.5997,Virgie,"not really, big problem with it is that the haskell runtime (in full) has to be compiled and distributed with it; which is overkill for the vast majority of apps"
909,1553343375.6009,Corine,"makes sense, is it only a viable option for small - mid apps?; or not at all?"
909,1553343461.6019,Janna,"<@Lynne> Doesn't seem to work. I created the project with `create-elm-app` and opened it in Atom, so I assume the working directory is the elm.json directory? Can I set it manually somehow?"

912,1553424207.6068,Moriah,"I think I’m losing my mind. Would someone want to explain to me why the following Ellie will not compile?

If I’m using an extensible record, and I have a function that takes `Extensible a`, surely an `Extensible Something` would work, no?

<https://ellie-app.com/54NfSGxYCWpa1>"
912,1553424489.6078,Huong,"<@Moriah> what if I pass it a function `Extensible { foo : Int } -&gt; Extensible { foo : Int }` that updates the `foo` field?; Which is entirely valid according to your type signature, but of course wouldn't work since your records don't have a `foo : Int` field; My recommendation would be not to use extensible records for this, and group the common things in a regular record"
912,1553424910.6119,Moriah,"Yes, that’s true. So is it even possible to create a function that takes a function that only operates on the `Extensible` part of `Extensible a`?; I will follow that recommendation, I’m just trying to understand where my thinking went wrong."
912,1553425073.6145,Huong,"Not in Elm, but it _can_ be done in languages where you can be more specific with regards to quantification, e.g. purescript"
912,1553425162.6153,Moriah,"Ok. Thank you <@Huong>, you saved me a lot of time."
912,1553425413.6154,Huong,"so what you're trying to is something like this:

You have a function like so:
```
updateCount : Extensible a -&gt; Extensible a
updateCount r = { r | count = r.count + 1 }
```

With explicit quantification, that could be written as
```
updateCount : ∀ a. Extensible a -&gt; Extensible a
updateCount r = { r | count = r.count + 1 }
``` meaning that which function works regardless of what `a` is: it is valid for all values of `a`

What you're trying to write now is a way of embedding that signature in another signature, which means it _should_ look like this:
`(∀ a. Extensible a -&gt; Extensible a) -&gt; State -&gt; State`

But Elm doesn't let you do that, and instead you end up with `∀ a. (Extensible a -&gt; Extensible a) -&gt; State -&gt; State` which doesn't mean the same thing :slightly_smiling_face:"
912,1553425788.6157,Moriah,Is `∀` like `forall` in Haskell?
912,1553425909.6159,Huong,"yes, it's exactly that; <https://gist.github.com/zwilias/f9f5f8fa7c6b2dbcadcc537c982035cd> so this would be a valid purescript implementation of your idea :slightly_smiling_face:; <http://try.purescript.org/?gist=f9f5f8fa7c6b2dbcadcc537c982035cd>; (you can see what happens when you move the `forall a.` out to where it would end up in Elm)"
913,1553432853.618,Vallie,With a Keyed.node are the children's ids only stored in the virtual Dom and not actually present in the actual Dom?
912,1553433136.6188,Huong,"Yeah, they're not `id` attributes, they're just internal identifiers used by the virtual-dom"
913,1553433946.6238,Vallie,"Ok, then can you have a look at the issue raised on billstclair/elm-sortable-table (the elm 0.19 version of Evan's) which has a problem with the sorting. It appears to be flipping out the virtual Dom patching code and seems to be thoroughly reproducible. It is very worrying to my mind. Sorting by the Name column works fine. Then sorting by Price is OK too. But then trying to sort by Rating causes errors and bad output. Alternatively sorting by Name, then Rating, then Price gives NO ERRORS, but displays one row TWICE. I think this needs to raised as an Elm compiler issue, as there does not appear to be any problem with the code in elm-sortable-table (and indeed there shouldn't be a way to write Elm code that causes this problem). I just don't know where else to raise this."
913,1553435144.6247,Earlean,<@Vallie> what are you using for the node key?
913,1553436074.6271,Vallie,".name; It only appears to be a problem when sorting by a column of floats, followed by a different column of floats."
912,1553437258.6285,Huong,Oh; The example uses an outdated version of `elm/html`/`elm/virtual-dom`; Bumping the (indirect) dependency on `elm/virtual-dom` to 1.0.2 fixes the example.; <@Vallie> ^ (just making sure you see this :slightly_smiling_face: )

Read documentation, examine StackOverflow or other parts of the Internet for similar cases, think, try, fail, repeat.; You'll most likely get an answer if you show what you have done and what did not work, why do you think it did not work and what you think you are missing.; Just asking ""how?"" implies you just want a solution. That's not what community is for."
921,1553504955.6582,Hoa,<@Leopoldo> Do you have an online demo to show similar to the behaviour you are after ?
922,1553505725.6584,Hoa,I guess we are after something like this: <https://css-tricks.com/scroll-fix-content/> - in you case there are some fading but it’s a fx applied via css. So I guess one would use viewport to figure out where the scroll pos  actually is. <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Dom#getViewport>
922,1553506150.659,Leopoldo,<@Hoa> here is an example <https://bulkitv2.cssninja.io/landing-kits/kit-1/index.html>
922,1553506639.6593,Dorsey,"I'm trying to extract coverage information from `elm-coverage` for further processing. I see that `--report json` gives me nice information about complexity, but I can't find what was actually covered by tests. The data is there in the HTML output (the red vs green code), but it's hard to extract. Am I missing something? <@Huong>"
922,1553506783.6625,Huong,"Yeah, the coverage information isn't super straightforward for humans to read. Using the codecov reporter, you can get a json file that should conform to this schema: <https://github.com/zwilias/elm-coverage/blob/master/docs/elm-coverage.json>"
922,1553506797.6628,Robyn,"The use case is: have a flag that is similar to `--cov-fail-under` in pytest, which makes the elm-coverage exit with non-zero status. This is great for using CI to making sure people are not pushing commits that decrease the coverage.; And hence get slow incremental increase in test coverage"
922,1553506850.6642,Maida,<@Leopoldo> I think you can implement that by simply setting a class based on viewport data. Here is an example on how to do this: <https://ellie-app.com/55dpwC5Xxcva1>
922,1553506864.6643,Huong,"&gt; The goal of the reports generated by elm-coverage is to help you visualize what parts of your code are being evaluated when running your tests, and to try and guide you towards writing tests that focus specifically on the more complex functions in your codebase.
&gt;
&gt;The goal is not to condense that information down into a single metric. It is too easy to write tests that don't make meaningful assertions about your code and its behaviour, but only serve to increase the coverage.
&gt;
&gt;The only thing worse than having no tests is having tests that provide a false sense of security.; I feel very strongly about that :slightly_smiling_face:"
922,1553506937.6647,Robyn,"It is very reasonable; do you have a recommendation on an alternative way to have a computer do a basic “this PR has enough tests” check and inform the author, before I start the manual code review?"
922,1553507206.6656,Huong,"If you're using GitHub, the codecov integration can help with that a little - <https://github.com/zwilias/json-decode-exploration/pull/5>

Though in a general sense, I suspect that some human judgement is required still. :thinking_face:"
922,1553507282.6658,Robyn,"oh cool, thanks!"
923,1553511166.6661,Lynn,Is there a way around this npm audit error? I’m building for 0.18 so the recommendation is not a solution
924,1553512570.6671,Valeria,I have a BIG problem : <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/server-side-problem/3389> and would love to have feedback
924,1553512793.6675,Agustin,"I would not attempt to use elm on the server side thats for sure.; If you’re set on using GraphQL you’re going to have to map database rows to its types, thats part of how it works.; If you don’t want to build that there are several “GraphQL as a Service” providers.; I am surprised you haven’t considered Elixir and Phoenix/Absinthe. Its a very popular combination for backend, its immutable, and functional, just not strictly typed."
924,1553513008.6696,Valeria,You’re right :slightly_smiling_face:; Just added it to the list
925,1553514105.6706,Joan,"I got the requirement to provide an elm app as ""Widget"" (<https://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/>). Is there something in elm so that I don't have to do everything manually?"
925,1553515079.6707,Denae,Never heard of it and seems to be on its way to be deprecated <https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/65> so I doubt that there is anything else than maybe something on NPM for JS
925,1553517302.6709,Joan,Yeah - still AGL is using it for custom apps. So I'll cough up some build magic :slightly_smiling_face:
924,1553519689.6746,Dede,"<@Valeria> I think it’s worth your time to look at Rust.  I agree with <@Agustin> that Elixir/Phoenix will feel very familiar coming from Elm, but the lack of a strong compile-time type checker is super painful.  Rust’s type system is actually very Elm-ish.   I haven’t looked into Redis options, but the ORM support in the Diesel library is excellent and solves a lot of the problems you mentioned.  There are several web server frameworks to choose from with Rust, an overwhelming number really, but you can probably narrow your focus to Rocket and Actix without missing out too much.; (Would you prefer to have this conversation in Discourse or is it OK to chatter here?)"
924,1553520047.6753,Nana,"Rust seems pretty cool, but for general app development I'd think you'd rather not have manual memory management?"
924,1553520065.6755,Dede,"Rust has done an amazing job of making it not painful.; And the runtime performance is spectacular.  <@Valeria> specifically mentioned performance issues as a concern, which immediately elevates Rust to top-tier candidate IMHO.; For many tasks, most of the memory management still happens automagically behind the scenes based on baked-in RAII &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization&gt;; That said, Rust has a much more substantial learning curve than most other languages because it has a pretty unique memory/pointer management model and that takes some getting used to."
924,1553520249.6764,Nana,more than C++?
924,1553520270.6766,Dede,The model is much better than C++’s.; But there are significant differences.
924,1553520300.6771,Niesha,"It also inhibits random memory access, which makes non-FP bearable to FP people.; Sadly, no effect system though"
924,1553520310.6775,Dede,"I should maybe write a Rust tutorial for Elmists.; Yeah, most of the core is written in a way that lets you write FP."
924,1553520413.6779,Nana,so it has lambdas and proper closures?
924,1553520424.6781,Dede,"“It’s complicated” :wink:; Mostly the answer is “yes”.; Actually:  it’s a full yes, but subject to the borrow checker.; So you can write this, where the `||` is a closure taking no arguments and `|req|` is a closure taking one argument:
```
     my.code(|| {
                service_fn(move |req| {
                    serve_https(config, req)
                })
```; But there are two complexities that come up.; `config` and `req` are captured variables.; Let’s say `req` isn’t referenced from anywhere else after this.  Then the data can `move` into the closure — thus the keyword in front of `|req|`; But say `config` is — then you have a problem that this closure doesn’t control the lifetime of `config` necessarily.; Now, if `config` is of a type that implements `Copy` trait, no problem, the compiler will automatically copy it.; But realistically, it is not."
924,1553520709.6813,Timika,"<@Valeria> We use Scala (as a FP language, not a better Java) with Sangria (<https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria>), but I sadly cannot recommend it fully. But it might be worth to check it out - just in case it fits nonetheless."
924,1553520723.6814,Dede,"So you wind up writing this:
```
   my.code(move || {
                let config = config.clone();
                service_fn(move |req| {
                    let config = config.clone();
                    serve_https(config, req)
                })
            })
```; That’s the level at which manual management can bite.; “manual”; The borrow checker warns you — without the extra ` clone` calls the code won’t compile."
924,1553520943.6825,Kris,Rust feels too low level for most applications 
924,1553520954.6831,Dede,~It’s actually not.~; Let me retract that.
924,1553520963.6837,Kris,I would recommend purescript if you want something Elm like for a backend 
924,1553520965.6839,Dede,"That has not been my experience.; Once the learning curve is achieved, I have not found it to be notably less productive than ‘higher level’ languages."
924,1553521395.6845,Niesha,"I've coded Scala for 4 years (now full PureScript), tell me your pains so I can add them to my list :smile:"
924,1553521527.685,Timika,"Yeah, it’s far from perfect. We had Scala at our company before switching to pure-FP some time ago. In that sense, having Scala already established was a big help. But now we’re looking for something better… But if I would say one thing about Scala I dislike the most, it’s “implicit hell”, especially with libraries like `cats`."
926,1553521609.6874,Caron,"<@Valeria> if you want I can show a small bootstrap of what we currently use at a future meetup.
We currently use Haskell, without complicated extensions, it's quite close to Elm overall."
926,1553521717.6876,Timika,"We had code break at runtime because an implicit was missing. Compiled fine, but had totally different runtime result. :disappointed:"
924,1553521803.6878,Timika,"I’m interested in a Haskell setup that is close to Elm - can you elaborate a bit what you think are do’s and dont’s? You mentioned complicated extensions, what qualifies as a complicated extension for you personally?"
926,1553521854.6882,Kris,Most of them? :stuck_out_tongue:
926,1553521861.6885,Timika,Do you enforce this by some guideline document or is just every developer on the same page and tradeoffs between complexity and gain are made on the fly?; I heard that `OverloadedStrings` is basically a _must_. Do you think that’s true?
926,1553521927.6898,Kris,Yeah 
924,1553521942.6902,Timika,_Someone_ needs to write a blogpost about this. *cough* *cough*
926,1553522042.6919,Luba,"I have a lot of requests to a service that uses authentication. Sometimes the token expires and I get a 401 responsen and then I need to make a refresh request, update local storage though ports and the redo the initial request. Do anyone have a _good_ solution for this? I have tried one where I use Task so make a chain of requests with refresh and retry and then in the response sets both the response to the request and new session credentials in i got some. But it feels complex and I need to add credentials to every msg I have."
926,1553522060.692,Kris,"I was joking when I said most of them, when you read about them you can recognize which are ""complicated"", some are required for specific libraries, etc"
924,1553522103.6922,Kris,"Tbh, there are _tons_ of blog posts explaining extensions, see <https://ocharles.org.uk/pages/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html> for a pretty cool one"
926,1553522130.6924,Timika,"I find it incredibly hard to get into Haskell, not the language, but the ecosystem and best practices."
924,1553522173.6932,Kris,"Yes, the ecosystem (package management and stuff) is terrible in my opinion."
926,1553522224.6941,Timika,We had a “getting started with haskell” brownbag session. And most folks had to compile IDE support (<https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine>) from source and we basically did not do anything. It was very telling.
926,1553522253.6948,Luba,"And another question. Is there a differens between Http.request and Http.task. When using Http.task I get a 403 from the server even though the arguments are identical (except that task doesn't take ""tracker"")."
926,1553522352.6951,Kris,"Yup, that's pretty much it, I use nix which alleviates some of that (it has binary caches with prevent you from having to build some things from source) but it's still quite flaky"
926,1553522359.6953,Caron,"Our setup on the backend is Servant + Elm-export (it generates elm equivalent types to your haskell types, and all the encoders/decoders you need). We then basicly only use the very basic things : custom types, maps, folds, etc.; There is, indeed a bit of complexity in a part of our system which I won't name (it starts with M), but people don't need to manipulate it when creating new feature."
926,1553522523.6962,Luba,"And I had to implement my own resolver like this:
```resolveJson : Json.Decode.Decoder a -&gt; Http.Resolver Http.Error a

942,1553600121.7507,Velia,"This is not as easy as it sounds, this should work:
```

Can I write a decoder in a generic way to handle `task` as one of several possible options? I've also tried instead creating a `Task` enum with all the types of task records that can be in there, but this seems to fail"
942,1553600315.7522,Nana,"<@Gertrude> it's possible to write fully generic JSON decoder, have a look at : <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Microsoft/elm-json-tree-view/latest/>; ah nvm"
942,1553600382.753,Miguelina,Thx... this will take a while to absorb...
942,1553600390.7534,Niesha,"<@Gertrude> Elm cannot generically derive decoders, no. However, you can ask it to try a few different decoders."
942,1553600437.7543,Nana,"you could write `projectDecoder : Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (Project a)`
just like `Decode.list`etc. work"
942,1553600521.7551,Gertrude,~~Hmm. I'm wondering if the issue is how to pass the right constructor to Decode.succeed. I guess enum record types don't create the same kind of constructor as a type alias~~ (wrong avenue)
942,1553600561.7555,Danika,Ms doing elm dev??
942,1553600575.7556,Velia,"Well the use of `loop` makes it look more complicated than it is, but this avoids stack issues. It would look simpler by using a recursive parser."
942,1553600624.7563,Nana,<@Danika> yup it's <@Carl> at MS
942,1553600676.7573,Sharon,you don't have to use a constructor if it doesn't fit. you can write your own function there that takes the parameters and composes a value of the right type
942,1553600737.7583,Gertrude,"So I have my `Project` decoder defined like this:

```
projectDecoder : Decoder (Project task)

        |&gt; required ""id"" int
        |&gt; required ""name"" string

942,1553600835.7586,Miguelina,"No, no... loop is totally fine! I just used it for building a list. It's just that I'm very new (2h) to parsers."
942,1553600970.7588,Velia,"Ok, anyway here is the recursive version without tail-call elimination:

942,1553601076.7605,Sharon,`reportableTaskDecoder` and `markableTaskDecoder` both have their own task-type instead of the generic `task` ?
942,1553601159.7613,Gertrude,"Yes. They're both record types, though similar, and the API is guaranteed to only ever have same type lists (ie. all projects have a list of only markable, or only reportable tasks)"
942,1553601207.7622,Miguelina,Thx!!
942,1553601253.7631,Gertrude,"I can express this potentially with an enum as well, but this gets cumbersome because I need to write constructor functions  for each, which is a lot of code for only two record types possible, and also wrong, because a `type Task = Reportable | Markable` or similar enum would allow mixed type lists of tasks"
942,1553601372.7635,Sharon,"Well your function is trying to implement both `Decoder (Project ReportableTask)` and `Decoder (Project MarkableTask)` at once, but you can't do that because they are different types.
I think the easiest is to just make 2 different functions. Then maybe see if you can extract common logic afterwards"

        |&gt; required ""closed"" bool
```"
942,1553601573.7658,Sharon,"Yea, like that. But the problem of the mixed types comes from the `oneOf` (which is extracted out here), that will need to be separated anyway"
942,1553601821.7674,Gertrude,"Yeah. Extracting that out to a different function still has the same problem. I think maybe this is not expressable how I think; It's not lists' fault, it's that they types make no sense. a non-list decoder would have to look like `or : Parser a -&gt; Parser b -&gt; Parser ?` which makes no sense.; Ah! I get it now. I missed the point of <@Nana>'s code. We make taskDecoder an  argument, and pass the right decoder when I need it, which thankfully works for this."

954,1553683326.8275,Caron,"<@Virgie> no, I mean inside of an app, if you have a module that exposes some things for general purpose and some things for test only.; <@Antonette> I agree with you on a general basis, but I need to test the internal logic of the module itself, because it is not trivial.; and I don't want to package it away considering the other problems introduced by that route."

974,1553788894.03,Ghislaine,"You could create a capped list, don’t you?"
974,1553788923.0302,Linda,What is a capped list? Do you mean just truncating the list?
974,1553788949.0304,Ghislaine,"Yeah; I mean, its not the same as having a virtualized list of components but it could do the job."
974,1553789041.0308,Linda,"That's not quite what I want. The user should be able to scroll all the way up to the first message, and then all the way down to the last message. They should have access to all the items in the list. The VirtualList would do the hard work of just rendering just the visible rows."
974,1553789045.031,Ghislaine,if someone scrolls to the top then u load the older messages; and so on
974,1553789072.0314,Linda,"But if they keep scrolling to the top, we want to stop rendering the newer messages; since it's expensive to keep all these nodes around"
974,1553789104.0318,Ghislaine,that’s why you will always keep this capped list synced with context
974,1553789143.032,Lynne,"So you basically want to prevent list from changing its width when it is scrolled, is it correct?"
974,1553789173.0322,Linda,"height* if you imagine a vertical list with dynamically sized rows; If you have this capped list, your scrolling would be broken I think"
974,1553789217.0326,Yang,from what i see - 2 concerns get mixed up here. 1. is what content we show to the user. 2. what elements we actually have in the list.
974,1553789218.0328,Ghislaine,if the user is not at the very bottom of the chat then u dont need to append the new messages to the shown capped list but instead to a recent messages list (hidden) maybe
974,1553789228.0331,Lynne,"Ah, okey, so you want the chat window to have the same height all the time?"
974,1553789229.0333,Linda,"Basically it should look like all the content is there to the user, but under the hood it should be efficient in how it is displayed.; Yes. With an inner scroll"
974,1553789267.0337,Lynne,Why not fixing it some value then?
974,1553789282.0339,Linda,"Because the content is dynamically sized.; Look at this demo: <http://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List>; and click the ""Use dynamic row heights""; Slack does this to display their chat messages"
974,1553789349.0347,Ghislaine,why would the scroll be broken?
974,1553789350.0349,Lynne,"Well, this example has fixed height; `style=""box-sizing: border-box; direction: ltr; height: 300px; position: relative; width: 2528px; will-change: transform; overflow: auto;""`"
974,1553789390.0353,Ghislaine,i’ve used that kind of solution with react but I think this will really over complicate an ELM implementation for such issue
974,1553789391.0355,Corinne,<@Yang> I don't think you'll ever escape the limitations of IEEE 754 floating point in JS. Have you considered a BigDecimal-type library approach e.g. <http://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js> ?
974,1553789452.0359,Linda,"<@Lynne> I'm talking about the heights of the row, not the container"
974,1553789467.0361,Lynne,I see
974,1553789505.0363,Linda,"<@Ghislaine> Hmm, so do you think it would need some native js hacking to do this properly in elm?"
974,1553789533.0365,Ghislaine,"yeah, I wouldn’t recommend it tbh"
974,1553789557.0367,Linda,Is there another solution? Rendering all the items in the list isn't feasible
974,1553789565.0369,Lynne,I may miss some crucial points of why it has to be done this way but in my imagination there is absolutely no problem doing this in Elm
974,1553789602.0371,Yang,"you sugest i should buuild the equivalent of this library in elm? or use ports? I cant use ports since this is part of an algoritm that needs to be done in 1 go - i cant wait for async stuff. Still working on the string implementation. Gonna extract that value out of the scientific notation. ex ""1e-8"" -&gt; 8. since is pretty easy. Gonna see if it passes all my tests. Feels like a hack actually."
974,1553789613.0373,Lynne,"For example, I don't understand why it has some inner scroll container with changing height and absolutely positioning elements with top offset"
974,1553789635.0375,Linda,That's part of the virtualization; Not all the items in the list are really there on the dom
974,1553789678.0379,Lynne,"I understand this, but that's very easy to do in Elm: just do not generate `div`s for elements you don't want to show"
974,1553789724.0381,Yang,gonna take a break. thanks:)
974,1553789728.0383,Linda,"hmm, sorry that I'm not expressing myself properly, and thanks for your help.

If you don't generate the divs for elements you don't want to show the size of the scroll container will be incorrect"
974,1553789729.0385,Ghislaine,that’s basically what I said :stuck_out_tongue:
974,1553789736.0387,Lynne,"Ah, with dynamic height you won't be able to determine which elements to show correctly"
974,1553789738.0389,Ghislaine,"capped list, show only a subset of data and there u go"
974,1553789740.0391,Lynne,Now I understand
974,1553789771.0393,Linda,"<@Ghislaine> a capped list isn't right, because you want to reserve the space for the rows that aren't rendered; Look at the slack chat, The messages above your messages aren't rendered; but the scroll shows that you are near the bottom. If you move near the top, the messages at the bottom will disappear from the dom. Even though they've disappeared the scroll size of the container and the scroll bar haven't changed"
974,1553789856.0399,Lynne,"Yep, that's why you need that large container; Interesting"
974,1553789936.0403,Linda,"android's recycler view does this, ios' list view does this. Angular has a virtual scroll ...; Lot's of folks find this pretty darn useful; Other examples: <https://github.com/domenic/infinite-list-study-group/tree/master/studies>"
974,1553789988.0409,Lynne,"Well, given the popularity of the tools you have mentioned it is not surprising"
974,1553790048.0411,Linda,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view/latest>; Is what I've found for elm
974,1553790067.0415,Lynne,"Well, you can use that React component I think and build it in your Elm app via custom element; Then if you get data in Elm you can send it to port and update your React component with it; May work; The Elm package you found supports variable height, but you have to calculate it inside your Elm app. I suppose this is not suitable, right?"
974,1553790247.0425,Lorilee,"I’ve got to solve this same problem very soon. I’m not really sure how to do it in elm either. I’ve sen that infinite list package you posted, but I can’t tell if it will be easy to work with"
974,1553790311.0427,Linda,It's not feasible to precalculate the height of markdown-ish text; It seems really hard to hack this even if you shell out to react
974,1553790340.0431,Lorilee,"For the item height, there should be some kind of heuristic for a “minimum height”. Say, height of the text"
974,1553790368.0433,Nana,it'd be exactly the same in JS as in Elm I think
974,1553790379.0435,Lorilee,"font size of 14px, means that each message will be at minimum 14px"
974,1553790383.0437,Linda,"right, but then you have to take into account code blocks, or formatting options. Then take into account user accessibility settings"
974,1553790403.0439,Lynne,"Well, but as soon as item is rendered first time you can know its height and record it in the app"
974,1553790415.0441,Linda,yep
974,1553790417.0443,Lorilee,"As long as the item height is only used as a decision for how soon to load data, it doesn’t have to be exact"
974,1553790439.0445,Linda,it used to figure out scrolling height and scroll behavior; Here's a well thought out blurb about this: <https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/issues/6>
974,1553790576.045,Lorilee,"For my current infinite-scroll in an inverted-chat-like-scroll window, I use a mutation observer to change the scroll appropriately when items are added. I wonder if that could be useful. It could be adapted to fire custom DOM events on the scroll container when certain things happen. Lots of JS, but it might be better than a custom element because you could still use elm to display the children."
974,1553790591.0452,Lynne,"So would it work if you started with some heuristics about default height, and then updated it when the item is rendered by the browser?"
974,1553790865.0459,Linda,yeah that's a decent strategy.
974,1553791641.0463,Lorilee,"As you work on this problem, would you mind sharing what works for you? I’m probably going to see what I can do with the mutation observer path."
976,1553792677.0465,Nana,"I decided to take a shot at it :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://ellie-app.com/56HF2PXcTgga1>; seems to work"
976,1553793490.047,Linda,sure
977,1553796306.0473,Yang,hey :smile: passed all my 18 tests :smile: thanks. But i seen 1.45e+33... returns 0. Gonna look more into if thats normal. Maybe my tests are not very good yet. But thanks again.
976,1553797246.0476,Nana,1.45e33 doesn't have any decimals; no number with a positive exponent should have
976,1553797742.048,Janiece,1.234567e3 has a positive exponent but definitely has decimals :slightly_smiling_face:
976,1553797793.0482,Nana,but it doesn't stay in that format; it converts to 1234.567
976,1553797861.0486,Janiece,<@Yang> I think the only solution that makes sense is to use a small tolerance in `exactFloat` (and maybe rename it to `isApproximatelyIntegral` or something)
978,1553798262.0488,Janiece,"I wonder what the actual heuristic is for how `String.fromFloat` chooses whether to use scientific notation; But even if it works, it seems like a pretty hacky solution"
976,1553803084.0494,Nana,"<@Janiece> hmm yeah that might work better actually, that way you can avoid the `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30000000000000004` problem"
979,1553804396.0496,Yang,"thank you everybody, ive settled on a solution aproximate to what is in ellie. Plus an using the exactFloat  as i had in the code above. It passes all the tests i have built. As <@Rutha> pointed out any e+ number is actually converted to its dot notation when stringified. So spliting  by ""."" works. Feels like a huge hack though.."
980,1553807570.0513,Kent,Hi. I have updated my elm version (npm install elm --global) but have noticed that the elm repl no longer returns the type signatures of functions. Did I mess up somewhere?; (+) returns &lt;function&gt;; When I run elm --version I get 0.19.0

980,1553807907.0552,Huong,"In what way? Also, just to double check, you're running `elm repl`, not `elm-repl`, right?"

985,1553846030.0673,Nana,"there's no backlog; if your app is slow, the framerate will be lower, so fewer onAnimationFrame events will be dispatched"

x.filter isEven
 and then get an error "" you gave me a list number, I need a record with a remove field"". Im probably making a dumb mistake but I'm not sure what to do."
989,1553875626.084,Dede,"Rust has several good webserver options.; You probably want
`List.filter isEven x`; In some contexts it might be clearer to write
```
x |&gt; List.filter isEven
  |&gt; nextTransformation

```; Core point, though, is that Elm doesn't attach operations to data.  You have to explicitly call functions.; So `List.filter` calls the `filter` function defined in the `List` module."
989,1553875766.0858,Florencia,"<@Nikia> So, you're trying to chain stuff like `myValue.method args` - but in Elm it happens through function application: `fn args myValue` etc."

989,1553875799.0865,Florencia,"even if `myValue` is a List, you can't use `List.filter` like `myValue.filter foo`"

992,1553879162.093,Huong,"Oh absolutely. It's just easy to forgo writing actual tests, and before you know it, you're writing examples that test edge-case behaviour :smile:; I have to remind myself that the examples are just that: examples. I can verify their correctness. To check that they code they demonstrate is correct, I (should) write actual tests"
992,1553879241.0955,Dorsey,I suppose for edge-cases fuze tests are great. I had a lot of fun writing them lately!

note i have `SPrice` twice and i have no compilation error. Can this be considered a bug? Since is a mistake. the correct version should be:

993,1553892206.1112,Lashawnda,You’re welcome. Whenever I see `_ needs a _ on the right/left` errors I always look for an arrow in what the call produces. Usually the compiler can tell when you forgot an argument to a function but there are a couple cases like this one where it can’t 
994,1553894164.1141,Izola,"Hi all, I have this list:
```[ A, B, X, X, A, D, D, D, A, B, X, A, C, C, A, A, B, B, B, B, B ]```

```[ [A, B], [X], [X], [A, D, D, D], [A, B], [X], [A, C, C], [A], [A, B, B, B, B, B] ]```
Is the recursive function with two arguments (like: `fn : List a -&gt; List (List a) -&gt; List (List a)`) the way to go, or is there an easier way?"
994,1553894550.1146,Kris,Have a look at groupWhile from the list extra package

996,1553913062.1174,Florentina,Hey! I was just about to start off with my first Elm projects that uses WebSockets. I just wanted to know whether `elm-lang/websocket` would work with `0.19`.
996,1553913174.1182,Earlean,<@Florentina> it doesn't work with 0.19.  you need to use ports instead; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-websocket-client/latest/> is a package that makes using ports for websockets a bit easier. 
996,1553913230.1195,Florentina,I see. Thanks for the quick reply! :slightly_smiling_face:
997,1553936913.1196,Denae,If you want something that's more like Elm with better tooling than haskell why not try F#? You can do class-oriented but you don't need to. Have a look at what SAFE does server side (giraffe+saturn+Elmish) <https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/intro/>; + postgres obviously ^.^
998,1553941441.1273,Mireya,I am starting an iOS/Android project that accesses a local SQLite database and I would like to use Elm. Is this feasible? What would be the best tool to use with it (Capacitor/Cordova/React Native)?
998,1553941486.1276,Lynne,<@Hsiu> may have something to say about it :slightly_smiling_face:
998,1553942186.1296,Monnie,<@Mireya> I use plain xcode and android studio.. just open a fullscreen webview and does the rest in elm.. native code can easily be called with ports..
998,1553945025.1324,Mireya,I’m not sure I would call it “easy”. Are you saying I can go directly from Elm to Swift/Java and back with ports? Is there a tutorial on that?
997,1553945346.1326,Monnie,"You need an incoming/outgoing port  set up in Elm, native ios/android can send messages to elm directly, but you will need to add a small function in javascript to forward messages from elm to native.... after that you just add messages on swift and elm side when you need more functionallity..  Searching for javascript interop Wkwebview or android webview should give your some guides.. its pretty slimilar... An example for IOS: <https://medium.com/@JillevdWeerd/creating-links-between-wkwebview-and-native-code-8e998889b503>; Using ports to native swift/java code is actually pretty similar as interop between elm and javascript.; My current application is augmented reality.. So I show the camera nativly fullscreen and load a transparent webview on top of the video.. the rest of the userinterface/overlay is done in elm."
999,1553973936.134,Nikia,"Hey everyone, I am currently trying to create an app where a certain key in the dictionary has an updated value upon clicking. I am almost sure that I have more than a couple problems with my current code. But right now I am getting an error with my init function. This is the error : I was not expecting this equals sign while parsing an expression (in
parentheses) in init's definition.

Im pretty stuck and some guidance would help. Thanks!"
999,1553974208.1347,Timika,"First, your `Dict` is missing the types it uses for key and value. After that is done, the other issues can be solved, I am happy to assist if necessary. :slightly_smiling_face:; `type alias Model = { fruits : Dict }` From what I can guess from the code is, that you want to store fruit quantities? Sadly, you cannot use custom types for the key, as your keys have to be `comparable`, so we need to find a different solution there. If the amount of different fruits is not too large and does not change often, you can just use a record instead."
999,1553974351.1361,Nikia,"yes exactly, I changed it to fruits : Dict Fruits Int
However, I'm still getting the same error."
999,1553974397.1367,Timika,"Yeah, the construction of your `Model` value is wildly different from what the compiler expects.; `{ fruits = Dict.fromList [(""Apple"", 1), (""Grapes"", 0) ]}`; (Note that I used `String` here, not “Fruits” due to the issue explained in my previous comment)"
999,1553974573.14,Nikia,Would it possibly be a good idea to create a function that gives each fruit a string name
999,1553974596.1406,Jin,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/pzp1997/assoc-list/latest/> is a 1:1 replacement for the core `Dict` that also supports non-comparable keys. Though it has different performance characteristics.
999,1553974708.1407,Timika,"“wildly different” even. :smile:; I try to avoid strings for logic in my programs when I can. Though it would work, I guess."
999,1553975983.1426,Nikia,Yeah so far I just tried using the Dict.fromList line that you posted above to see how I might be able to change it but I'm still getting an error on that line
1000,1553981105.1429,Hsiu,"I am using react native, but it could be an overkill if you already have native code for the views...

1003,1554020477.1549,Natosha,"Out of curiosity, how am I able to use a view function that returns Svg msg with Browser.element, which expects its view function to return Html msg?"
1003,1554020733.156,Lynne,"I think you would use `Svg.svg` in your `view` which creates `&lt;svg&gt;` node in HTML but still returns `Html msg`, thus making it suitable for `Browser.element`; In fact, both `Svg` and `Html` are just aliases for `VirtualDom.Node`"

1006,1554074835.1643,Nikia,"So Im making a game right now and I am a bit stuck on what I should do to add multiple random levels. Its a very basic game and basically how it works is there is a balance scale and one end of the scale it has some number of weight that you need to balance on the other side. You use the many items provided to balance it, and once you've balanced it, you do it again with a different number. I want to do this at least 4-5 times.

1007,1554106577.1731,Maxwell,"Where can I find documentation for ""messages with a payload""? I am not sure this is the term the community prefers. I also searched for ""parameterized messages"", ""passing arguments to a message"", etc. I only found one place where this is briefly mentioned in <https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial/blob/master/en/02-elm-arch/05-msg-payload.md> by <@Carrol>.

I am also interested in why this doesn't come up more often. Perhaps the reason this is undocumented is that it's a rare pattern or because I am missing something obvious.; It basically says that ""You can send a payload in your message"", and shows some code, but there's no other explanation. There's no explanation for how some messages will get a payload from DOM events like onClick, etc., anyway.; To clarify, I am not asking how to send a payload in a message. That's clear.

I'm asking where is the documentation for this feature and because apparently there isn't, why is that?"
1007,1554106848.1768,Gertrude,"I think this is just an odd way of phrasing the common pattern that Message type constructors can take arguments, which I wouldn't describe as a rare pattern at all. I use it every day!"
1007,1554106908.1782,Maxwell,"Okay, so should I search for Message type constructor then? Is this documented? :slightly_smiling_face:"
1007,1554106916.1784,Gertrude,"You can see the same patter, for instance, in the Text fields section of the book: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/text_fields.html>; *pattern"
1007,1554106962.1799,Maxwell,"Thanks! Yeah, I can see the _code_, but no explanation of whether this is a runtime feature, language feature, etc. I'm looking for documentation, basically."
1007,1554106978.1802,Lewis,"it's not specific to message types – that's just a custom type, like many others. see here: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/custom_types.html>"
1007,1554107143.1819,Gertrude,"Yeah. Since messages are just another kind of variant type, and variants can take arguments, it's a common pattern for sending a message that contains some data you want handled by your `update` function. I think there's no specific name for it because it's just such a common pattern no one thought to give it one."

1007,1554109454.188,Earlean,"<@Gertrude> yep, you need to convert your value to a comparable type. There are packages that make this easier to do. But it's certainly not optimal.; For small sets you can use <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/erlandsona/assoc-set/latest/>"

1010,1554112864.1906,Huong,"I don't know if that exists. Essentially, what happened is this:
- Elm was FRP
- people started using this pattern for modeling applications
- Elm adopted that pattern and made it a core-concept of the language

I don't know if anyone then tried to express this pattern in a formal way.."
1010,1554113955.1908,Agustin,Doesn’t Evan have a dissertation on it?
1010,1554114456.191,Florencia,I think the dissertation is on Elm itself
1010,1554115200.1912,Agustin,Yes but that must surely have a section on TEA ?
1010,1554115761.1914,Florencia,It might not have been all that well defined back then; Checked the PDF and neither `TEA` nor `architecture` are there; the thesis seems to be concerned with FRP quite heavily
1010,1554116153.1929,Danika,"I have Evans thesis, it indeed is just about FRP. Elm was a quite different back then. I’ll try and reach out to him"
1010,1554116293.1931,Huong,"&gt; This architecture seems to emerge naturally in Elm. Rather than someone “inventing” it, early Elm programmers kept discovering the same basic patterns in their code.; (from the guide); :shrug:; I do remember Phil Freeman asking about a similar thing, in the context of wanting to refer to TEA in a paper. Let me see if I can dig up that paper, and see how they handled it..."

1012,1554119310.1957,Nana,the future is comonadic eh? :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
1012,1554119329.1959,Maida,"a little bit of extra history: There was a time before Elm had `html` support. Once `elm-html` appeared, people started using it and discussions about architecture started to emerge. The architecture was mainly about the signal graph. In the end, Evan created a package called `start-app` that formalized this graph that kept appearing. The community started using `start-app` extensively. This was around Elm `0.15`. With `0.16` this pattern was so frequently used that it ended up being adopted as the default pattern in `0.17`.; <@Danika> if you want to dig deeper into the history, I recommend you look at the git history of the `start-app` and of the `elm-todomvc`."
1012,1554119635.1963,Nana,"do you think Elm should still be considered FRP now that you can no longer ""fold/map over time""?"
1012,1554120175.1965,Sharon,"The blog post announcing 0.17 is titled ""A Farewell to FRP"" :sweat_smile:"
1012,1554120177.1967,Huong,"Not in the academic sense of the word, in that Elm, the language, no longer offers the fundamental building blocks of FRP. However, those building blocks underpin TEA, and the result is functional and - in a sense - reactive. So in a casual sense, I personally don't mind Elm being described as ""kind of like FRP"", as long as it's clear that we're not talking about FRP in the traditional/academic/scholastic sense of the word. Relevant to those formulations of FRP: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agu6jipKfYw>"
1012,1554120718.1969,Danika,"Thanks for reminding me about `start-app` <@Maida>, I have actually seen it before but I forgot about it ^^ <@Huong> do you know if Elm still is FRP ""under-the-hood"" or has the runtime ditched signals as well?"
1012,1554121094.1971,Huong,"That's a harder question. If someone were to write a bunch of kernel code, they could build on top of the current runtime to offer the same FRP building blocks Elm pre-0.17 used to offer. Since it would require kernel code (effectively extending the runtime), I think that would answer your question in the negative! Is that a good enough answer?"

This messed up my state. Strangely, the example worked before, but my bigger application broke badly. The example works in the new order, and my application works, but the auto-repeat feature, which works fine in the example, does not work in my application.

Here’s the example, as an Ellie: <https://ellie-app.com/58tgQKX3HZma1>
And in its package repository: <https://github.com/billstclair/elm-svg-button>

There are four buttons, The top one increments by one. The second one also increments, but will increment every 1/10 second after a 1/2 second initial delay, if you keep the mouse button pressed. The bottom two buttons do the same for decrement.

I’ve checked that the `Time.every` call is happening in my big application, but it doesn’t repeat, only increments once. Can anyone think of a reason that `Time.every` would wait until the mouse button is released to deliver the first `Msg` to `update`?

type alias Model =
    { appRequest : AppResponse

    }
```
I need to handle the loading state of each as sometimes it’s a graphql-query and sometimes it’s a mutation…
Should I wrap those into one field and set it in my update function as a command from the other two commands?
I found myself making a kinda nasty case statement to try to capture both of those scenarios…"
1015,1554151441.2147,Sade,Hey <@Jeanene>! Have you tried Remotedata.map2? That may help clean it up. I would recommend storing them separately as you have it now and then using map2 to combine them in your view
1015,1554151480.2148,Jeanene,Haven’t tried using map2--that’s a great recommendation. I’ll refactor with that and see how it feels. :thumbsup::skin-tone-3:; Thanks!
1015,1554151513.2159,Sade,"Awesome, let me know if you have any other questions on that! :smile:"
1015,1554151817.2161,Jin,"One other option is to create a custom `RemoteData` type that encapsulates the possible states. I like to do this when I’m e.g at first querying one object, then have a mutation to update it. This allows me to show an initial loading spinner, then a pre-filled form that also has its own loading indicator, but that also keeps the form around while sending the request.
This should also be possible with two separate `RemoteData` fields, but there might be impossible states possible. This depends on your use case of course. But custom types are nice in Elm."

are you having problems generating the number? generating _random_ numbers or comparing floats?"

The issue is that there's a noticeable pause at, say, 99% downloaded before Elm draws the result to the screen. I believe it's just that the data is so large, decoding it takes a while. The pause is long enough that some users think the application must have stopped, so I'd like to update the progress message (to, say, ""Rendering"" and a spinner instead of ""Loading"" and a progress bar).
As far as I can tell, the only way to do that is to decode the data on a separate step through the event loop. I have this mostly working by using `Task.map (\_ -&gt; &lt;…do decode…&gt;) Process.Sleep 0` to get a task that is immediately ready, but this feels like a hack, and it also feels like it makes the delay even longer (though I haven't timed it).

1022,1554198206.2436,Antonette,"<@Gertrude> one thing you can do is pull dependencies out by concern. For example, you could extract the `Model` type from your main into its own `Model.elm` file and pick things that focus on the model (transformation functions used in `update`, etc.) into this file, maybe factor some parts of update into it, taking care about not putting other concerns into it (i.e. a function that uses `Model` and `Msg` like `update` should probably not go into your `Model.elm` file).; Once you've got a `Model.elm` file you may want to extract your `view` function from your main file to put it into its own `View.elm` file ; this `View.elm` file can import whatever it needs from your `Model.elm` module just as the `Main.elm` file does, etc.; Another thing is recognizing parts that repeat ; maybe you've got tabs that are very similar but for a couple of params (the message they send when clicked on, the label of the tab, whether it's the current tab or not, ...) ; that might be tighter and easier to update if you factored the common code.; One last way I'd mention here is when you've got something that clearly is a subpart of the main view and acts like its own little view (its got its own subpart of your `Model`, it could have its own `Msg` and `update`, it has its own `view`, ...) ; this is a good sign that you could factor this out in its own module (or set of modules depending on its size and complexity)."

I especially like using refactor pattern like using type aliases for simple types then growing them into full-fledged types and using the compiler as a refactor tool that tells me where the change in contract is messing things up and working them from there."
1024,1554209013.2677,Gertrude,"Yeah. I think in this case, the types that are all that big are mostly already factored out, ie. I have a `Types` module ATM which contains all my common data types and their JSON encoders/encoders and any helper functions for working with them. But something like `Msg` almost doesn't make sense to factor out because it's basically the smallest type in my code. XD; ie. It's not Msg that's big, it's `update`, but factoring that out without also factoring out `Model` and `Msg` quickly gets into cyclic dependency territory"
1024,1554209140.2681,Antonette,Indeed.; That's why I wouldn't advise you to start with factoring out something that has dependencies.; It's like playing mikado ; you want to pull the fancy stick at the bottom only once you've moved enough of the easy ones up.; :wink:

1027,1554226820.2764,Janiece,"<@Jana> in general there's no avoiding floating point roundoff completely, but you should be able to get nicer/more accurate results by using division instead of repeated floating point addition:

List.map (\i -&gt; toFloat i / 1000) (List.range 0 1000000)

Web components give us a choice. I look forward to a date picker of the same caliber, we seem pretty far from it. Same for charting.

1043,1554304467.349,Cammy,"Question: I’m in a situation on a work project where I need to use file select and then post it to a rest api. elm/file makes the selection part of this easy, and elm/http 2.0 would also make this easy, but the team has voted to keep HttpBuilder which is not compatible with 2.0. 

I’ve been creating a dataUrl from the file, passing it through a port and uploading, but there’s a limit on the size of the file I can do this way, both a hardcoded limit in some browsers and a practical limit because doing this with a 50mb file (which some of these files are) is somewhat unwieldy. 

Anyone have thoughts on how I could pass file data or a blob through a port? Am I missing something?"
1043,1554304751.3506,Huong,"My personal vote would be to write something that gives you the httpbuilder API, for elm/http@2.x. Over time, you'll run into more cases where the dependency of http@1.x becomes a blocking issue - libraries you wish to use, new elm version, ..."

1052,1554381792.3734,Gertrude,Is it possible to trigger a `Msg` in my `init` somehow? Or at least on program start?; I'm using elm-uuid so I can create some unique IDs for something and I'm puzzling how to pre-populate the first value so I can use it in some other update branches
1054,1554383139.3748,Antonette,"Sure you can, through a `Cmd` or directly by calling `update` in `init`.; I don't know elm-uuid, but I'd wager that if they require you to seed some values through side-effects, there must be a function to get a `Task` or `Cmd` you can use to initialize your model.; There, look at this:; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/danyx23/elm-uuid/latest/Uuid#uuidGenerator>"
1054,1554383362.3784,Gertrude,"I wound up doing this:

```
send : Msg -&gt; Cmd Msg
send msg =
    Task.succeed msg
        |&gt; Task.perform identity
```"
1054,1554383407.3793,Antonette,"So, this is a `Generator Uuid` ; `Generator` is a type that can be used with `Random.generate` <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Random#generate> to give you a `Cmd msg` that gets a value of the type the `Generator` provides (in this case a `Uuid`)."
1054,1554383459.3801,Gertrude,as it turns out I can't use UUIDs for this anyway. XD; I need instead to somehow make unique integer IDs. :stuck_out_tongue:
1054,1554383476.3808,Antonette,"Well, at least now you know how to get one when needed :wink:; Depending on how unique you want your ids to be, a `Generator Int` could do the trick.; <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Random#int>"
1054,1554383681.3846,Gertrude,"Yeah. The issue is I have this list of ""Entries"" and I need to make sure that when I create a new one as a placeholder, I need to give it an id that doesn't match any of the others."
1054,1554383696.3852,Antonette,"With a `Generator` however, there is always a slight chance of picking the same number twice, so it might be a good idea to not just blindly accept any number it spits out, or do something a bit more unique-y like maintaining a list of available ideas in which you pluck one each time, and maybe add one back once you've thrown it out."
1054,1554383701.3854,Gertrude,"Fortunately, I have the ability to query for the latest entry, so I will just grab that and add one.; It's SQL sequential IDs so this should work, since I don't actually even send that ID back to the backend, it's just there to prevent edit collisions"
1054,1554383752.387,Antonette,"The only downside to this plan is when you reach the highest possible `Int` ; in which case the ""recyclable"" list of available ids may do the trick.; If you want to prevent edit collision, I'd advise you use a way to distinguish ""persisted"" ids from ""draft"" ids.; (like an `Id x y` type: `type Id x y = Draft x | Persisted y`)"
1054,1554383983.3898,Gertrude,"yeah. currently the largest ID is in the 1mil range, and we accrue about ~500 new IDs per day."
1054,1554384063.3912,Antonette,"Then the `type Id x y = Draft x | Persisted y` might be just the trick. You don't have to start your draft increment from the highest know ID, and you have a way to easily distinguish between persisted and draft elements."
1054,1554384092.3914,Gertrude,"Hmm. Could do.; but on the flipside, it will, at present usage, take over 11,000 years to hit the ID cap of an Elm Int max size.; each entry is also specific to a date, so it only has to be unique against other entries on that date, which further prevents collisions. I've probably been over thinking this."
1054,1554384566.3949,Antonette,"As long as you don't get oddities from an id being set on a draft while an element is persisted in the database with the same id, you should be fine I think."
1054,1554384598.3952,Gertrude,"Yeah. When new entries are saved we don't send the ID.; and saving an entry triggers a refresh response of the entire list of entries from the backend, so that they once again reflect whatever's in the data base."
1054,1554384679.3969,Antonette,Then my advice is: don't overthink :wink: you'll still be able to change it later if you need something more robust anyways.
1055,1554385732.3971,Marcellus,Luke got me this list <https://www.meetup.com/topics/elm-programming/all/> which is decent!
1054,1554385895.3986,Gertrude,"just now I learned a thing: a Msg is sometimes a function and sometimes a value, and so Elm's type inference will assume the latter if you try to pass one as a generic value.; So if you have a message `EditEntry String Entry`, and you pass `EditEntry` to a function that expects a `msg` generic type variable, it will not realize that `EditEntry` is a constructor, and so if you then try to give it arguments it complains that it is not a function.; You have to make explicit that you're taking a constructor function for a msg: `(String -&gt; Entry -&gt; msg)` will work."
1054,1554386084.4019,Hoa,The way I see it is that `msg` is a generic value/function/whatever for Elm.  If you use `Msg`  the compiler can be more precise; makes sense ?
1054,1554386122.4028,Gertrude,yeah. In this case I have not yet refactored such that I can refer to Msg directly in the function without cyclic dependency. This may be a good moment to fix that.
1054,1554386644.4048,Carter,"I have this ""non optimal"" use case where i would like to call java code from elm. I found ""TeaVM"" that lets you compile java to .js. So i guess it would be doable with elm ports. But, i wonder if theres an even better solution?"
1054,1554386759.4051,Niesha,Java code? You're running it on the backend?; Just make it a REST API call.
1054,1554386784.4058,Carter,yeah that too. But i would like to call java code clientside
1054,1554386797.4063,Niesha,How would you run Java on the browser?
1054,1554386800.4064,Carter,"Well, thats the thing - i dont want to do that; Theres that TeaVM. I compiles java to js.; so through elm ports id be able to call it; its just one function but involves quite a bit of types; (classes/intefaces as java calls them)"
1054,1554387179.4087,Corinne,"<@Carter> sounds like you want a fork of TeaVM (or in fact plain GWT) that transpiles to Elm directly...; Note their docs though:
&gt; If you are a JavaScript developer who is satisfied with JavaScript, TypeScript or even elm, you probably won’t need TeaVM."
1054,1554387300.4103,Carter,"well, i need to share java code between server and client"
1054,1554387427.4107,Corinne,I agree with <@Niesha> here - API is the way; (unless you want to use a Java Applet of course :laughing: )
1056,1554388557.4113,Willodean,Hey folks
1054,1554388566.4117,Willodean,"I am back writing Elm once again!; I wrote a Modal yesterday and could use feedback on the approach; I used the krisjenkins style type for the Modal; And it worked fine. I had a button in the UI that sends a message with my Modal type inside; Problem is, it doesn't sync with the model after it fires the first time; So I end up with something like this; ```
type Model = Model
  { ...stuff
  , modalState = Toggle
  , modalView = Model -&gt; Modal Msg
  }

type Msg
  = ...stuff
  | OpenModal (Model -&gt; Modal Msg)

1054,1554389186.4201,Gertrude,is it generally necessary to expose anything but `main` from your `Main` module?
1054,1554389275.4202,Carman,"No, you should be able to expose just `main`"
1054,1554389480.4204,Gertrude,I thought so. was wondering why I was bothering to export anything else but I think it's just something elm-format did
1054,1554389671.4207,Sharon,"if you want to use function from your Main module in the repl, you'll need to expose them :slightly_smiling_face:; That is a problem. I think we need some more information to figure out why; Is it maybe possible to share an example on <http://ellie-app.com/> ?"

I’d like to get comments on a draft once I get to that point.  Is there a way of doing that on Medium (or some other place)?  I am particularly interested in comments on things that I am doing that are not efficient.  As the model scales up in size, (NxN cells), it slows down considerably. At each step, N^2 computations have to be done.  Thanks!

1062,1554414927.4432,Izola,"Hi! I wrote a tetris game <https://ellie-app.com/59Thpkzr5G9a1>, but I'm having issues with rotation math - shapes are rotating weirdly. Rotation works by rotating each block around pivot point (visible in ""Pause"" mode). If someone good at math could take a look, I would appreciate the help :slightly_smiling_face: I put the rotation functions at the top of the code..."
1062,1554415040.4438,Virgie,"I'd suggest you use elm-geometry for this kind of thing, specifically <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry/latest/Point2d#rotateAround>, unless you really want to figure out the math yourself"
1062,1554415152.4447,Izola,I'll take a look. Thanks!
1062,1554416208.4459,Janiece,"I took a quick look and I think there might be a couple issues. First is that you're using the top-left corner of each block as its `Location`; you're rotating it properly (assuming you want a clockwise rotation), but then *the result is no longer the top left corner* (that corner is now the top *right* corner, if you're rotating 90 degrees clockwise). By treating the result as the top left corner again, you basically add an extra one-block shift to the right."
1063,1554416270.4461,Janiece,"Also, for anything but the square piece, the center of rotation does not have integral coordinates - this means that some of the resulting points will not have integral coordinates, and will then get rounded which I think causes additional weirdness"
1062,1554416322.4463,Janiece,I suspect it might make more sense to round the coordinates of the center to be integral before doing any rotation; I'm obviously in favor of you using `elm-geometry` but in this case I don't think it's the actual rotation math (`rotateLocation`) that's tripping you up :smiley:
1062,1554416859.4468,Izola,Thanks for the input! I'll try to adjust points to the center of block before rotation then convert to grid points after. That might work...; I'm trying out `elm-geometry` right now :slightly_smiling_face:

I can send messages using long-polling to Elixir and change things on the server, however I cannot get Channel.on “event” Function to actually here the “event”; Has anyone had success with this?; Or similar trouble?"
1066,1554431345.4541,Earlean,<@Vesta> have you set up the ports for it?
1066,1554431449.4552,Vesta,Well… no… I suppose I have not — I thought this was an alternative to that. I was encouraged by the fact that I can send to phoenix without an issue…; I didn’t find any helpful documentation on doing that with the phoenix-sockets package so didn’t realize it was necessary.
1066,1554431581.4567,Earlean,"ah, I see. It's not using websockets, it's just doing long polling"
1066,1554431591.4571,Vesta,Right.
1066,1554431634.4579,Earlean,Are you calling `listen` and returning it from your `subscriptions` ?; what is `model.phxSocket` set to?
1066,1554431915.4608,Vesta,None; That’s directly from the example.
1066,1554432290.4619,Earlean,and then you use `join` to join the channel you get from `Channel.on` ?
1066,1554432381.462,Vesta,None; None
1066,1554432443.4634,Earlean,<@Vesta> where do you update the model with the value in `updatedSocketModel` ?
1066,1554432525.4645,Vesta,"In JoinChannel I don’t update it, but I do elsewhere… is that the issue?"
1066,1554432526.4646,Earlean,"perhaps you want ` ( {model | phxSocket = updatedSocketModel}, newCommand )`; if you don't use the value returned from a function then it was pointless to call the function as it did nothing; if you don't update `model.phxSocket` then your `subscriptions` will subscribe you to the old socket which doesn't include joining the channel"
1066,1554432767.4666,Vesta,"Yes, this makes sense — yet still doesn’t seem to have solved the issue.; I made another channel2 function that I am calling elsewhere where I definitely am resetting the model.phxSocket also and still no dice.; I’ve tried using the Push.okOk command as well to see if I can trigger something on an “ok” response."
1066,1554432961.4692,Earlean,You should try to make a simpler example that only joins one channel so you have a good understanding of how the package works before making it more complex; I suspect you're ignoring return values in other places too
1066,1554432997.4701,Vesta,Well it is only one channel.  I just made another function to test other things.
1066,1554433052.4706,Earlean,can you show a complete example?
1066,1554433099.4714,Vesta,"Yes, np — I’ve been banging my head on this for a couple days.  I’m about to call it quits and just do it with ports and javascript and elm."

1072,1554466993.5102,Jin,I used to use <https://github.com/cortesi/modd> back in the days; Though this is not really shell script only

1075,1554469585.5169,Gertrude,"So I have a tricky situation with an API: I need to save a set of `Entries` to the server. Each `Entry` is a single API request, and replies with an `EntryUpdateResponse` which contains the newest list of entries which I use to update the UI model. Thus, I need to batch multiple requests, and then, to ensure that I only use the most recent response to update my data.
I can do the former just fine. Just build a list of entry requests and give it to `Cmd.batch`. But `Cmd.batch` is non-deterministic; there's no order guarantee, and so my UI goes into wrong states because requests resolve out of order.

How I fix?"
1075,1554469815.5184,Carman,"I think you may want to fire off the requests one at a time and build up a ""queue"" of entries to be saved"
1075,1554469993.522,Velia,"Note that even if `Cmd.batch` was processing in order, I don't think that there would any guarantee that the network or web server would keep it, and that responses would come with the same order. So the problem is more an API one."
1075,1554470096.525,Gertrude,"<@Velia> the original JS version works but just doing a for loop and blocking on each request in turn until it's done, only keeping the last response. It's slow but ... it does work."
1075,1554470102.5252,Antonette,"As <@Velia> says, if you can change the API, I think you should create a way to batch updates, which will lower the time spent establishing http requests (always a good thing) and maybe perform saves as a transaction (often another good thing)."
1075,1554470125.526,Velia,"<@Gertrude> then this is what <@Carman> suggests, do one ~Cmd~ request at a time."
1075,1554470165.5273,Antonette,"Then again, if you really want to save batches of updates as a sequence, you probably should chain `Task`s instead of batching `Cmd`s."
1075,1554470248.5289,Gertrude,"I honestly don't care about any of the intermediate responses, just the last one in the queue. Alternately, I can just fire off all the original requests, ignoring their bodies, and just do a new GET at the end to get fresh data. But that still means being able to guarantee that the GET happens after all the others."
1075,1554470334.5305,Antonette,Hence why you could/should? chain the queries as tasks imo.
1075,1554470360.5317,Gertrude,Yeah. Are Tasks deterministic then? I see there is a `Task.sequence` at least
1075,1554470380.5324,Antonette,"You'd be guaranteed to send them sequentially and to get a `Msg` only at the very end.; And yes, they are :) that's why `Cmd`s are not.; You can see `Cmd`s as a way to ""wrap"" `Task`s in a non-sequencial batch, and of not caring about success/failure when you don't want to."
1075,1554470517.5364,Gertrude,"&gt; Start with a list of tasks, and turn them into a single task that returns a list. The tasks will be run in order one-by-one and if any task fails the whole sequence fails.

Hmmm. That could be messy. If one of the requests fails that could leave me with half the batch undone? Also there seems to be no `jsonResolver` for HTTP tasks."
1075,1554470637.539,Carman,How do you currently handle batch failure?
1075,1554470670.5394,Gertrude,Good point. It kinda ... doesn't yet.; I think this may be the point where it is just more sane to update the API.
1075,1554470756.541,Antonette,Sounds like the better course of action to me (if you may).
1075,1554471188.5417,Gertrude,"yeah, I'll have to see. The immediate endpoint is hours, but that's basically just a proxy for a third-party API"
1075,1554471295.5418,Willodean,It needs to be a function to allow it to sync. The version I posted of my model features a solution that does sync. It's just ugly.
1075,1554471599.5423,Sharon,"I guess I don't understand how something goes out of sync in elm. The view should always reflect the current state of the model, no?"
1075,1554471599.5425,Emilee,"hmm, should i decode stuff from javascript in the subscription function or in the update function?"
1075,1554471619.5428,Timika,IMO as soon as possible.
1076,1554471701.5435,Maida,"<@Emilee> keep decoders as far away from your code as you can. :slightly_smiling_face: This means, as close to the edges of your app."
1075,1554471805.545,Maida,"I prefer to interact with a module that handles every interaction with the server and is called from inside of the app with all the arguments needed to be able to reply with a `Cmd msg`.; This means that, in your context, I will always decode at the subscription."
1075,1554471858.5459,Emilee,that's fair
1075,1554472029.5489,Felisa,"How do people handle the (incredibly common) scenario where you have several form fields which all need to hold valid values before the form can be submitted (or the submit button enabled)?

```
case (field1, field2, field3, field4) of
    (Just v1, Just v2, Just v3, Just v4) -&gt; Just (submit v1 v2 v3 v4)
    _ -&gt; Nothing
```

but obviously that doesn’t work in Elm 0.19"
1075,1554472074.5493,Maida,<@Felisa> have some kind of validation; you can use something like `elm-validate`
1075,1554472114.55,Felisa,"Just a big stack of nested `if` statements then?; Sorry if I wasn’t clear: I’m not asking how do you validate a single field, I’m asking about how you organise multiple validations now that tuples are limited to 3 elements"
1075,1554472270.5517,Maida,"`elm-validate` helps with that; if you don’t want to use a library, take a look at `elm-spa-example` to see how you can easily implement a validation:
<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Page/Settings.elm#L356>"
1075,1554472315.5535,Carman,I usually use some data structure that models valid/invalid/initial and do a `mapN` on it
1075,1554472319.5536,Emilee,"there's a bunch of form and validation libraries, for example <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/hecrj/composable-form/latest/>"
1075,1554472482.5545,Antonette,"And if you need something stronger than `elm-validate`, there's `the-validator` <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Bastes/the-validator/latest/> (cue Terminator credits soundtrack); :wink:"
1075,1554472495.5549,Felisa,"Cool, thanks for all the pointer! :slightly_smiling_face:"
1075,1554472693.5568,Carman,"In your simplest case where you're using `Maybe` to model valid/invalid you can use a `mapN` function like:
```
Maybe.map4 (\v1 v2 v3 v4 -&gt; doSomethingWith v1 v2 v3 v4)
  field1
  field2
  field3
  field4
```; This will give you `Nothing` if any of the fields are `Nothing` just like in your code snippet above; and if all the fields are present it unwraps them and pass their values to the given lambda"
1075,1554472926.5588,Felisa,That works but is limited tp `.map5` so not that much of an improvement over tuples.
1075,1554473482.5593,Nana,<@Felisa> if you need more you can use `Maybe.Extra.andMap`

1077,1554475594.5625,Huong,"As far as I can think of, that _should_ work; When compiling multiple main modules into a single file with `elm make --output bundle.js Main1.elm Main2.elm`, it all uses a single elm.json and shared code is deduplicated, however, in your case, you're merging the compiled artifacts under a single `Elm` variable.

I'm using auth0.js to renew the token so I need to use ports to call it but this means I can't just chain a request on after (using Tasks).; One option would be to queue up Cmds that need the JWT, with something like
```
type alias Model =
    { jwt : Jwt
    }


type Jwt
    = Ready String
    | Renewing (List (String -&gt; Cmd Msg))

type Request

1084,1554503420.6096,Dede,<@Kimiko> You can make that distinction in onUrlRequest when the argument is a  <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#UrlRequest>.  By the time you are in onUrlChange that information is lost (unless you stashed it in your model somewhere.)
1084,1554503536.6106,Kimiko,"Yeah. Just to confirm, the `state` property of the `popstate` never makes it into Elm, which makes certain things harder"

1085,1554541695.6148,Maida,<@Danika> what are you trying to understand with this question? Are you looking for the actual implementation of the diffing algorithm that makes sure that event handling is happening efficiently?
1085,1554542100.6186,Danika,"Basically, yes some implementation details. The question just popped in my head as I was going to bed :sweat_smile: I’m working on a TEA-like js framework and while i probably won’t keep it, i wanted to implement my own vdom. 

There’s a slight implementation difference where I have event listeners set up separately from the view; in hindsight because both Attributes and Events are part of the vdom elm should have an easier time knowing if / when to change events "
1086,1554543555.6193,Maida,"In that case, just look at the JS source code for the virtual dom. Code looks pretty readable."

module OurModule parameterA exposing (ourFunction)

ourFunction =

and then in another module referencing it with
```
import OurModule 5

-- Returns 5
a = OurModule.ourFunction
```; I imagine this would be useful for any-dict implementations where instead of the dict storing the compare function or it needing to be supplied in every function call, it could be just supplied once when importing the package; If you wanted to import the same parameterized module multiple times then I imagine the syntax would look like this

When you change the value in the input field you will see the logging of the `ValueChanged` message (with the correct value), but when you click inside the textfield you will always get the logging `Value ""initial""` instead of the actual value.  Not wrapping the `Decode.succeed` within the `oneOf` fixes this. Any ideas what the cause could be?"

Hang on.; Oh, I see.; So, hypothesis:; You are capturing (Value model.value) when you define your decoder when the view is first drawn.  That gets baked into the click handler, because it’s evaluated when `view` is.  It gets stale as you update model.value until `view` in its entirety gets called again."

1091,1554582770.6584,Isaiah,"It took a while, but I created a minimal example. and it seems that the problem has to do with initializing the subscriptions. I am initializing them at a later time when the user navigates to a certain part of the application instead of as soon as the bundle loads in the browser.; I don't see why this would work differently, but it does; I'm using an XMPP client library to build a chat client, and the chat history is what fails to load through ports because of this race condition, and also causes any incoming messages to be dropped at the port interface, but as soon as I send a message out myself, it starts working. That must be triggering some kind of reload on the subscriptions"
1092,1554584333.6617,Ashton,"Are you sure? That might be expected behavior, however difficult. There are tricky race conditions with subscriptions.; I think, sending out cmds, updating the dom, and subscribing/unsubscribing are all synced on animation frames for the most part."

1092,1554584492.6648,Ashton,"Yeah, but it could still be synced to the animation frame. Im not sure.; I havent checked this question explicitly, but my expectation isnt that, when the new subscriptions are set, they arent simply set right there on the spot, but instead that the new subscriptions are diffed from the old ones next animation frame, and correct ones are unsubscribed, and the new ones are newly subscribed."
1092,1554584672.6675,Isaiah,"but it works sometimes on on the initial page load, randomly; I wonder if if would make sense to have this be a completely separate application that is loaded simultaneously alongside the main application and embedded in the page in a node; there is little data shared between them, just some initialization values; I built my current application as one large program with multiple ""screens"", including a login/register screen, a lobby, and the main game screen.

1092,1554587036.673,Augustus,That debugger one is annoying! If the project will build with the debug flag on you could use Debug.log to print out the current Msg/Model at the top of your main update function. If it won't build at all with the debug flag on I don't know a good solution :-/
1092,1554587373.6732,Isaiah,I use Debug.log to print out every message in the console already. I just got used to it after a while
1092,1554589979.6735,Huong,<@Augustus> you can use `Debug.log` without the `--debug` flag - you just can't use `--optimize`

1094,1554605614.6777,Maxwell,"Ah, okay. So, fragments are not the ability to return an array, but the ability for the VDOM to treat an array of nodes as a single entity (virtual node); for example, can you key the list?; <https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html#keyed-fragments>"
1094,1554605840.6791,Kris,"No, you key the elements "
1094,1554605892.6796,Maxwell,"Sure, that's a different thing. So, it's not supported, no problem. I just needed to confirm that.; Would be nice to know what the rest of the elm community thinks about fragments, but it seems no one is losing any sleep over that."
1094,1554606628.6809,Kris,I don’t see the usefulness 
1094,1554615048.6856,Emilee,"If you need non-encapsulated lists in a keyed list, you can do that. Write a function `List (String, List (Html msg)) -&gt; List (String, Html msg)`
the only use i see right now is for definition lists, though doing that without this function doesn’t seem much harder and the keys would make more sense.
My view on this right now is that it’s a nice trick for the react Dom to have, but I don’t think it’s necessary in Elm"
1095,1554615809.6875,Earlean,It makes a lot more sense for React because of the focus on 'components'.  Fragments give you the ability to have a list of elements as a single component which lets your list use all the features that React components have. For Elm all you'd be getting is the ability to hide that it's a list.

1098,1554628145.7,Ashlie,"You can definitely get it as a JSON value but you'd probably have to stop using the elm/file package and write your own stuff instead.
You'd create a file input element and use the `on` function from Html.Events to detect when a file is selected. `on` allows you to use a custom decoder on the JS event object. If just decode it to a `Json.Decode.Value` instead of a 'real' Elm type, you can pass that directly through a port.
So your custom decoder would be something like:
`<http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at> [""target"", ""files""] Json.Decode.value`"
1099,1554631289.7017,Lynn,Anyone else feel that the new Http library (2.x) makes working with Http Tasks disproportionately hard - I feel like I am reimplementing almost all of the `Response -&gt; Error` code because it is not exposed

1099,1554653313.703,Charity,"We updates to http 2.x a while ago and we have not had any issues. Our back end systems send a common error format and we wrote a custom `Response -&gt; OurAppError` function that knows how to deal with status codes and response body such that we can bubble meaningful errors to our applications.

So yeah, we did need to write a custom error function, but I'd expect that eventually most apps would like to map errors into a type that is clear.; For example, it is helpful to know when a session expired vs getting an opaque 401 or 403 status and needing to figure it out.

Our servers send a correct status code and context in the body of the reponse which allow us to map it into an Error type which we can use to dispatch a Cmd.; I'm making some assumptions the issue here so hopefully this was helpful.  :slightly_smiling_face:"

1099,1554653911.704,Lynn,"what led to my question was the docs for Http.task “Just like request, but it creates a Task. This makes it possible to pair your HTTP request with Time.now if you need timestamps for some reason. This should be quite rare.”; that felt like a rather narrow vision and what e.g. <@Charity> describes is a totally different reason for using task; and then there is the simple desire to compose http requests, which was my main interest initially"
1099,1554654036.7047,Charity,"when you compose them, what is the use case?

Are you trying to run 2 things at a time or run things sequentially (e.g. get the time, then use the value of time to make an http req?)"

1111,1554751595.7551,Isaiah,"I've seen several different ways of structuring larger applications, but I am not satisfied with any of them so far. Richard's SPA example is okay for a stateless application with mutually exclusive ""pages"", but a stateful one will need to take a different approach. The approach taken by [this game](<https://github.com/Lattyware/massivedecks/blob/master/client/src/MassiveDecks/Scenes/Start.elm>) is not bad. I combined these two approaches for my current application, but I still find it lacking. For example, I don't want to load the actual application until the user is logged in, which means I'll need to create a sum type `type Screen = LoginScreen Login.Model | AppScreen App.Model`, and this continues throughout the application, resulting in many layers of nesting inside of sum types in order to guarantee certain conditions are met. This also avoids the problem where everything is wrapped in `Maybe`, but I still feel like there should be a better way to do it.

For reference, you can find the application I am building here <https://github.com/ericnething/roll2d6-client>. It's ~14k loc right now.

I also considered using a state stack (like in games or iOS) where only the state on the top of the stack gets updated and rendered, which would of course allow me to push/pop different models and swap them out. I noticed in the game linked above, localStorage is used to pass data around between ""pages"", but that creates a global mutable state, which is undesirable. Has anyone seen any better approaches for structuring a ""desktop-like"" stateful application?"

Elm-css currently performs some checks at runtime (this will be improved once/if the phantom branch is merged) and the hashing used to generate the classes (at each view) can become heavy.

1125,1554801849.789,Miguelina,<@Charity> Thank you for the gist!
1122,1554802123.7909,Sunni,you can solve this issue by owning /usr/lib/node_modules <@Gertrude> im not sure if its possible to change default global lib location of npm but a temporary fix would be just `sudo chown &lt;YOURUSERNAME&gt; /usr/lib/node_modules`; and probably you will need also need to somehow give yourself write access to `/usr/bin`; what i did was `sudo chown root:nikos /usr/bin &amp;&amp; sudo chmod g+w /usr/bin`
1126,1554803026.7929,Huong,<https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory> this is the recommended way to handle this; Messing with permissions outside of `/home` is generally not a great idea
1126,1554803280.794,Syble,"Try not to install packages globally. I understand the urge, I love to do the same, but this leads to a lot of pain. Best is to install in your project dir (which is the default)"
1122,1554803554.7943,Monnie,"```sudo npm install -g create-elm-app --unsafe-perm=true```
Should do the trick...
But changing the global install folder to  a folder in your home directory is probably the best option.."
1126,1554803754.7951,Agustin,`/usr` is ok if its your machine; `/usr/local` is especially ok on osx
1126,1554803809.7958,Huong,"Anything is ""ok"" if it's your machine. Doesn't make it a great idea."
1127,1554804276.7962,Shantell,"<@Dede> your approach make writing spa more easily for a beginner like me :smile: , thank you very much!"
1126,1554804666.7965,Shantell,"I put my stuff in your framework, it  works! until the one use subscriptions. I can not figure out how to get it to work. I can not fully understand your framework so far. do you have any example on subscriptions?"
1127,1554804881.7969,Gertrude,"well, for something like create-elm-app, it's sort of half the use case to have it globally. ditto the elm compiler really.; real problem is the insistence by Ubuntu that npm be installed such as to require root to do it"
1128,1554805167.7983,Sunni,<@Huong> here we are just changing the folder permissions nothing inside of it and we dont own the folder in the example above i just added myself to the group and let the group be able to write
1126,1554805243.7991,Sunni,if it was chmod -R then yes you would run into trouble since you would mess with the permissions of sudo
1126,1554805244.7992,Huong,"Yes, and now _everything_ running as your current user has permission to globally install stuff.; If you trust your own user unconditionally, you might as well be running as root :shrug:"
1126,1554805286.7997,Sunni,well if theres a way of setting npm global dir that would be a nicer thing of course but this is a work around
1126,1554805301.7999,Huong,"Yes, there is, and that's exactly what I linked to"
1126,1554805334.8001,Sunni,and globally installing things are not bad if they need some root stuf still they cannot do that
1126,1554805372.8003,Huong,"I don't mind globally installing things, I do mind globally installing potentially untrusted stuff, and giving potentially untrusted stuff permission to globally install more stuff :smile:"
1126,1554805386.8005,Sunni,Oh than that is cooler than my temporary patch :slightly_smiling_face: but can you explain please why do you thing being able to install things in path to be a bad thing ?
1126,1554805441.8007,Huong,"I don't. My point is more that you're giving your user permission to globally install stuff. The result of which is that any process you run as your user can now globally install stuff, without your knowledge."
1126,1554805533.8009,Sunni,yes but thats not a extremely dangerous thing thats what im trying to say :slightly_smiling_face: they still cannot perform untrusted operations and even if you dont allow global invocation they would be able to put things under some location and call by path; i dont see any difference
1126,1554805559.8013,Huong,They can also overwrite anything in `/usr/bin`; even stuff `root` might execute
1126,1554805788.8017,Sunni,not necessarily we are giving permissions to folder individuals which has no write access to the group there will not be affected by this; thats what i meant by not giving -R flag
1126,1554805896.8021,Huong,"- you give your user permission to write to `/usr/bin`
- you do something like `npm install -g seemingly-innocent-package`
- that package can now, while installing, overwrite files in `/usr/bin`; Anyway, long story short: more restrictive permissions is better for security, so when there is an option to do things without widening permissions, that's generally to be preferred.; This link explains how to do safe global installs with npm without requiring root: <https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory>"
1126,1554806583.8027,Sunni,totally agreed  :slightly_smiling_face: and again overriding default dir of npm is a way way better solution i just didnt know that

1129,1554809598.8033,Gertrude,"yeah, I've tried that, and at least on my Ubuntu machine it broke stuff and still had the same permissions issues"
1129,1554810419.8054,Inga,"manually changing npm's location to a world-writable directory is the best option by far, especially because some packages download raw binaries instead of only source code"
1129,1554810480.8072,Gertrude,"on other OSes and even some other Linux distros, npm ships by default to install to a directory in $HOME rather than global root; I don't understand why Ubuntu insists on the opposite. Even the NodeSource packages do it"
1129,1554810517.8088,Inga,"and I advise to do it as soon as you can because after you do it, your old packages' linked executables will still be pointing at /usr/lib; meaning you'll have to reinstall everything to the new location or manually move the packages and re-link everything in $PATH, which is ambitious; for me it was weird that even /opt restricts access from the users group, so I just created a /programs world-writable directory where I install e.g. programs from Github and other stuff not coming from APT; and moved NPM's home to /programs/npm-modules; never had a single issue with any permission after it"
1130,1554813762.8162,Dede,"Thanks for the kind words!  I have subscriptions working in the upstream app, but I need to port an example back to the public repo.  Probably by tomorrow afternoon (US eastern time zone.)"
1131,1554814333.817,Nana,"does `--optimize` have a big effect on runtime performance, or is it mostly bundle size?"
1131,1554814489.8176,Timika,"Depends on the code I assume, but for my hobby project it’s a huge performance boost as well."
1131,1554814527.8179,Nana,how huge? :smile:; like 2x or 10x?
1131,1554814578.8183,Timika,"No, not _that_ huge :smile:; I can only give you anecdotal fps values, but emulation ran like 10-20fps faster, just by adding ---optimize; Mostly because simple custom types just become integers and some opaque types are removed.; I wonder how much performance would be gained in a typical CRUD app."
1131,1554815490.8193,Gertrude,"The difference between the app I'm working on now in local, vs. the optimize build that gets deployed, is fairly noticeable; I don't have an instrumentation on it, but it's noticeably snappy, only slowed by network access"
1132,1554815550.8198,Shantell,"I’m looking forward to read ;D, thank you!"
1133,1554818086.8228,Inga,"The discovery about flip being removed in 0.19 left me hurting. It leads to the creation of things like this: <https://github.com/pilatch/flip/tree/1.0.0>.

is it really okay to remove a piece such fundamental FP helper simply because it's unknown to people not knowing FP? I think it will lead to people auto-including packages from there along with core wether they end up using it or not, or bringing up the next ""lodash"" to Elm.; Same applies to curry and uncurry, I do not want to have to think about installing those packages when I want to use them, so I'll just install by default in every project.; Then it becomes even worse than before because a beginner reading a code base will bump into those functions and not have been introduced to them."
1133,1554818254.8274,Dede,"As someone who came to Elm from a more imperative tradition, I haven’t felt pain in not having those.  It may be that Haskellers will reinvent Haskell in Elm, but the Lispers will do the same, and etc."
1133,1554818307.8285,Inga,"well, have you taken the time to consider possible benefits?"
1133,1554818334.8293,Niesha,"The benevolent dictators have decided flip makes codebases harder to read, discussion over."
1133,1554818378.8314,Sharon,"Evan doesn't remove things from the language without thorough consideration, though..."
1133,1554818384.8318,Inga,"I'm not arguing to bring it back, I'm just saying it will happen that people will reach for those third-party packages when they need them"
1133,1554818387.832,Dede,"Me?  No, there’s far too many people who would like to sell me possible benefits of the one true way for me to assess them all.  I’ve found it comfortable to take Elm as given and work with it as much as possible.  There are places I chafe (setters!!) but this isn’t one of them.; I’m curious — is there a formal place where people make pitches to Evan?  I’m pretty sure Slack isn’t it…. maybe the Discourse?"
1133,1554818579.8378,Earlean,The recommendation is to not use `flip` and instead in the rare occasions you might use it to instead write out a function
1133,1554818589.838,Inga,"To be clear I'm not pitching for anything, nor do I want to argue about Elm's philosophy, I just want to have a feel about your opinions adding this extra complication for the sake of making code ""beginner-friendly"""
1133,1554818624.8395,Dede,I love Elm’s small size.
1133,1554818632.8402,Inga,I guess it only becomes a problem if the libraries become popular?
1133,1554818635.8404,Dede,I think that’s an advantage to beginners and advanced developers alike.; (you asked for my opinion ;-)
1133,1554818770.8453,Inga,"The way I see is: we're adding this extra step you have to do when using those ""banished complicated functions"", and their use will also be shunned upon or discouraged, so we're hinting for you not to use them... BUT..."
1133,1554818783.8457,Earlean,"It's not just for beginners, flip is often confusing for people well familiar with it; When I see `flip (/)` I must pause and think hard about it, but `\x y -&gt; y / x` requires little thought"
1133,1554818940.8508,Kris,"These kinds of discussions are a bit useless, the decision’s been made from above recently, and such things don’t change."
1133,1554818984.852,Inga,"I guess it's aggravated for me that all of those, curry, uncurry and flip are such core pieces for expressing functional programming, and it saddens me to see them taken way
but let me reiterate that I don't want to start a discussion or anything; It's not like you can't use them if you want to"
1133,1554818999.8528,Dede,"Wait, that makes no sense, you’ve definitely come here to start a discussion :wink:"
1133,1554819112.8556,Inga,"I don't want to argue or prove a certain point so it doesn't qualify as a discussion, I just wanted to know your viewpoints"
1133,1554819137.8568,Earlean,For 'core pieces' they were used very rarely in Elm code even before they were removed
1133,1554819139.8569,Inga,so thanks everyone that gave me some feedback; I actually only have started to know Elm since two days ago so I'm trying to get a feel for how things are
1133,1554819279.8609,Dede,<@Earlean> is there a formal way for people to make language proposals to the Elm core team?  Or is that not so much of interest?
1133,1554819391.8624,Danika,"It's also worth considering that Elm is made for javascript developers, not haskell <@Inga>; purescript exists if you want some haskell clone on the front end"
1133,1554819481.8645,Sharon,"we want *everyone* and all the *folks* to feel welcome, don't we?"
1133,1554819491.8649,Earlean,<@Dede> there isn't as far as I know. A post to the Discourse is the best bet
1133,1554819508.8655,Dede,"Awesome, thanks."
1133,1554819523.8664,Danika,"Well of course, I just mean from a design decision perspective"
1133,1554819556.8687,Teddy,"What <@Earlean> said, its also helpful when making such a proposal to include prior research in the field around the proposal and data that you've collected from the community and your own experiences. Evan highly values that sort of research."
1133,1554819647.8715,Earlean,"Yeah the post should show research in to the feature, how it's handled in other languages, and other solutions to the same problem etc; This was mentioned in one of Evan's talks"
1133,1554820098.884,Inga,"Elm as a whole seems to have a bunch of niceties that makes it enjoyable to work with, so that's where I'm weighing most of my likeness towards... I do care about having something that works nicely
For instance, the reason why I don't code in Haskell, or Purescript, or any of that is due to the toolchain's complications and slow feedback in general you get throughout the whole development process
Meanwhile with elm-make and the other tooling I get very fast feedback and it feels much more at home for me

I don't think it's helpful to say ""just ditch Elm if you disagree with X"" or have the narrative of ""trying to make X in Elm is bad"" because of all of the extra reasons you would choose to work with something."

1133,1554820294.8911,Antonette,"Said it a bit before, but a way to do away with unnecessary lambdas and their arguments *and* `flip` is to have functions with the arguments flipped and good names:
- `\x -&gt; x / 10` =&gt; `divideBy 10`
- `\x -&gt; x - 3` =&gt; `minus 3`
- etc."
1133,1554820359.8927,Inga,"yes <@Antonette> and point taken, between this exchange and your comment there I was able to form an opinion"
1133,1554820498.8955,Niesha,Works for backend too.
1133,1554820527.8961,Antonette,"To add a bit on this, one of my own ""pains"" in Elm compared to Haskell is the lack of typeclasses ; with them we could have optics that compose with `&gt;&gt;` ; but since composing is the main reason optics are interesting, we added lots of composition functions so we could have an idiomatic way to do so.; So, instead of having it the Haskell way:
```
optionalFromAtoD = lensFromAtoB &gt;&gt; optionalFromBtoC &gt;&gt; prismFromCtoD
```
We can still do:
```
optionalFromAtoD =
    lensFromAtoB
        |&gt; Compose.lensWithOptional optionalFromBtoC
        |&gt; Compose.optionalWithPrism prismFromCtoD

Im about 6,000 LOC into a Haskell project, and so far for me, typeclasses in practice are just having to tediously add `deriving (Eq)` or writing an `instance Show Thing where` for all my types."
1133,1554821087.9102,Inga,"99% of the time I disregard ""pain points"" because I understand it's a different beast, and even before that, the question was raised to bring a core-lib decision to the table (as in, affects the whole) which is not the same as a feature change (e.g. the removal of custom operators, which I don't mind either, but that's once again beside the point)
just to REALLY say once more that I don't want to have anything beyond what was asked, nor I think it's right or wrong"
1133,1554821165.9116,Antonette,Are you sometimes using `do` syntax?; Or `fmap`?; Or optics?
1133,1554821194.9122,Ashton,"Ive avoided `do` and `fmap`, but I use them when I have to.; I dont know what optics are. Is that like lenses?"

1133,1554821277.9131,Ashton,"The kinds of types I `map` are `Maybe`, `Either`, and `List`. For those I do `List.map` and `Data.Either.Extra.mapRight` like I might in Elm.; Are you suggesting that typeclasses are much more valuable to codebases that use `do` and `fmap` a lot?"
1133,1554821341.9144,Antonette,"They're necessary to `do` syntax and `fmap`.; `do` syntax relies on the ""invisible"" type being a `Monad` instance (thus having a `&gt;&gt;=`/`andThen` implementation); `fmap` is the generic `map` that maps over any kind of functor.; Now, the cool thing with those is that they allow you to not rewrite any functions that rely on the core typeclass functions to provide that functions functionality."
1133,1554821525.9158,Dayna,"<@Ashton> What kind of project are you working on? Seems strange that in 6k LOC you didn't have to work with a foreign data format (derive FromJSON with aeson), or had to serialize data for a database (derive FromRow with postgresql), both of which you have to write boilerplate decoders/encoders in Elm for."
1133,1554821526.9159,Antonette,"It's a bit less of a pain in Elm since there's less need for monadic acrobatics (like using monad transformer and such), and I agree implementing them might lead developers making quite unreadable codebases.; The main reason I'd like them sometimes is optics (since I've worked with codebases where models were deeply nested) :wink:; But then again I've worked around the main pain point by adding the `Compose` module to `elm-monocle` and it works pretty well for me now."

Arent typeclasses a kind of boilerplate?; Like, `deriving (Eq)` is just not a thing I have to do in Elm. In your json example, its not like I dont have to write a decoder, its just that, Instead of writing it as `decoder =` and then using that value, I have to write an instance of the typeclass.; Same code in two difference places, as far as I can tell."

1136,1554826452.9294,Antonette,"And the reason why you don't have to do this in `Elm` is because everything is natively ""equalable""... for better and worse. Try to test if a `Value` is equal to another... (spoiler alert, they always are equal to one another, whatever their content); Now, one pain point you can have with `Elm` is that you don't get to make your own `comparable` instances, thus can't use your own types as keys for a `Dict` for example.; (and now I have to leave from work... will gladly return to this conversation later if you're interested :wink:)"
1136,1554829218.9303,Nana,"and also if you create your own monad/functor/monoid/whatever you don't have to define `map2`,`map3`,`concat`,`andThen` etc.

1137,1554829504.9307,Bebe,"&gt; I don't think it's helpful to say ""just ditch Elm if you disagree with X"" or have the narrative of ""trying to make X in Elm is bad"" because of all of the extra reasons you would choose to work with something.

this is frequently done in the community. Elm is very niche and targeted to what it does, and if you don't accept that you are in for some frustration.

1139,1554840552.9365,Emilee,Is there a write-up on what it is trying to address?
1139,1554840652.937,Carman,I was already avoiding variable shadowing back in 0.18 after getting bitten by a shadowing bug so the 0.19 changes just meant the compiler enforced my personal style :slightly_smiling_face:
1139,1554840734.9377,Nana,"it's pretty common for linters to have warnings for shadowing, it's generally seen as bad style"
1139,1554840769.9379,Leoma,"The flip side is an “anti-shadowing” bug. That is, with MORE variables in scope, you have a higher likelyhood of accidentally using the wrong variable at a point.

Am I wrong to see that as an advantage of shadowing? I was just bitten by this and id took many days to solve.; I have never been bitten by a shadowing bug."
1139,1554840931.9384,Isaiah,"shadowing variable names is a sign you are doing too much in one function. Many nested case expressions for example: break them into functions. Erlang codebases are a good example of how effective this is. If you are shadowing in the case of matching on a `Maybe/Result`, I often prefix the name with an `m` or `e`"
1139,1554840940.9386,Carman,I also tend to write many small functions rather than large ones with nested `case` and `let ... in` statements so have few variables in scope.; Occasionally I'll use point-free style to avoid having to name an argument that might clash with some other identifier
1139,1554841072.9392,Leoma,"Well, I’m not 100% sure what “too much in one function” means in a pure language.
But I see that refactoring out chucks of code can fix the the problem."

1139,1554841235.9415,Isaiah,"Has anyone shared common code between multiple elm applications by listing the directory in `elm.json`'s `source-directories` like so? `""../../Common""`? Does this work?"
1139,1554841246.9416,Nana,"and when others recommend against something, Elm forbids it :male-police-officer:"
1139,1554841344.9419,Ashton,"Same as what others have said about small scopes. Having two things of the same type in the same scope creates the possibility of mixing them up. One value of each type eliminates this category of error entirely (which is, often not possible, but its my rule of thumb)."
1139,1554841375.9421,Leoma,"I guess the way I see it is, if I have `|&gt; (\x -&gt; x + y)` it’s clear to me where I think x and y are coming from. And possibly I want the function inline to remind me of its implementation.
Elm gives me 2 choices. 1 is rename x, where I can accidentally do `|&gt; (x_ -&gt; x + z)`, OR it forces me to refactor out a function where maybe I didn’t want to."
1139,1554841460.9424,Velia,"It works, as long as you install the required dépendencies."
1139,1554841557.9426,Leoma,Anyway. Seems I’m a minority in this perspective. That’s cool. I just wanted to see what others thought after having some time with this feature/limitation. :beers:

1139,1554841704.9442,Lindsey,"I wouldn't say mixing up vars is eliminated as a class of errors!  This kind of thing happens for me:
```let x = 5  -- original x value
   x_ = x + fudge -- changed it later!
in 
x + x -- forgot to change x to x_ here.
```; Yes and I hate using that when you are sharing between different repos.; What happens is you no longer know what version of the 'common' you are on anymore.; Probably the way to go is with git submodules, which I also hate.; For instance I might have project A and B both using common.  I change common in order to have a new feature in B, but now I've broken A."
1139,1554841943.9492,Nana,I think you should give `x_` a more descriptive name instead of just appending `_` though
1139,1554841946.9494,Carman,"In general, I think appending a `_` to the end of a variable to get around the shadowing restriction is a poor solution. As you showed, it's still easy to use the wrong one.; Ideally you're instead narrowing your scope, extracting functions, and passing values in as arguments."
1139,1554842046.9514,Leoma,"Yes, but then your’e confronted with the hardest part of programming. Naming the function. :cold_sweat:"
1139,1554842061.952,Lindsey,true true... but that kind of practice is up to old fashioned programmer discipline - its not a problem that shadow elimination solves automatically.
1139,1554842188.9538,Isaiah,"I currently have a single (large, 14k loc) application bundle with internal routing (and url changes), but I wonder if breaking parts of it out (e.g. login and registration, redeeming invite codes) into separate applications would give me any huge benefit. Right now, most of the application requires the user to be authenticated, and the login/register pages (along with the internal routing) add non-trivial complexity to both the codebase and the models used. If the server handles most of the routing, and I am able to break some of it out into smaller, single purpose applications that store any shared state in sessionStorage, I wonder how much easier it might be to work with."
1139,1554842260.9539,Carman,"True. Good point. The compiler eliminates the most egregious cases but programmers can still use poor practices* to simulate shadowing, thus bringing back all the associated issues.

_*poor practices - appending `_` is not necessarily bad in all cases, I'm generalizing here_"

```
x0 + 1   =   x1 + 2   =   x2 - 4   =   x3 + 10
x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 = 0

solve [ 1, 2 -4, 10 ] == [ x0, x1, x2, x3 ]

note the term `x0 + 1` is formed from the first element of the given list. So 1 and x0 are related - x0 being the first in the resulting list.

1157,1554933796.038,Raylene,"Yeah, the package Martin linked is very similar. Mine also has support for ADTs tho (something I haven't found elsewhere).

The key insight was that to support them you need to ask the user for a destructor (for example a destructor for `Result x y` is `(x-&gt;a) -&gt; (y-&gt;a) -&gt; Result x y -&gt; a`); And the types sometimes get gnarly in the implementation (again, in particular for ADTs), but it's one of those ""it compiles it works"" areas.

I'm particularly proud of the `recursive` method signature; Also, the same method can generate CRUD forms and type descriptions, but it does require yet another destructor (identical to the first, but Elm lacks hkp); Although I guess I could avoid the lack of hkp by using tuples as the `a` in the example above :thinking_face:; I definitely must publish this"

I could do that with `List` easily, but `Array`??; Maybe I’m early-optimizing but I think it’s wasteful to fold through the whole `Array` even if it’s only 126 elements"

1167,1555051927.0165,Bret,"interesting. he says:

`List` and `Array` has a length function, `Set` has size. This is likely due to the fact that `Set` is a thin abstraction on top of `Dict` and so has just copied the name. I would rename `Set.size` to `Set.length` out of consistency if nothing else.

I’d do the opposite. I’d rename them `List.size` and `Array.size`. `size` is a more general concept that applies to more structures than `length`; I heard <@Patricia> on the elm town podcast. Very interesting listen about his rewrite of the elm data structures."

1169,1555061713.0248,Huong,"because `Html.href` is a property, not an attribute; <https://ellie-app.com/5fdS28jmXPBa1> gives you the behaviour you'r elooking for, I think"
1169,1555061787.0252,Emilee,"i see. `href` is both an attribute and a property, technically, right? but if it's (understandably) coded as a property in `Html.Attributes` i can see why this crashes; good to know, thank :slightly_smiling_face:"

1171,1555066446.0588,Nana,<@Danika> that doesn't let you specify some of the optional arguments though?
1171,1555066461.059,Danika,indeed
1171,1555066597.061,Kenya,"<@Nana> Do you have functions that work on different records of optional arguments? Then the two argument approach would be the only one that works, or?"
1171,1555066632.0618,Nana,but I guess having two functions like `view : Required -&gt; Html msg` and `withExtra: Required Optional -&gt; Html msg` could be nice as a convenience
1171,1555073725.0627,Hoa,"Damn, Slate.js requires React; Well, Quill might fit the task equally well."
1171,1555073883.0634,Nana,"the only editor I've used before is TinyMCE, which I think was like 600 kb by itself :grin: not exactly ""Tiny""
but it had good features for restricting and cleaning up html"
1171,1555073984.0636,Hoa,I’ve used Quill a few years ago with React. I had a good  impression back then :slightly_smiling_face:; Oh wait. It looks ProseMirror is maintained too.
1172,1555076726.0676,Dede,"<@Nana> Have you considered a builder pattern?  Something like
```
module Thing
...
builder: RequiredParameters -&gt; Builder
...
build: Builder -&gt; Thing
...
setOptA: Int -&gt; Builder -&gt;  Builder
...
setOptB: Bool -&gt; Builder -&gt; Builder
```
And use looks like:
```
Thing.builder(requiredParameters) |&gt; Thing.setOptA 17 |&gt; Thing.setOptB False |&gt; Thing.build
```"
1172,1555076797.0679,Nana,<@Dede> that just seems more verbose though :thinking_face:
1172,1555076944.069,Dede,"Yeah, it’s a pattern I see commonly in languages that let you attach operations to datatypes, where you’d write
```
Thing::builder(required).a(17).b(False).build()
```; That said, if there are dependencies between the optional arguments, this gives you a way to enforce them."
1172,1555077019.0709,Niesha,You should be able to copy <https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-options/4.0.0/docs/Data.Options> and use a similar idiom
1172,1555077024.0711,Dede,E.g. setters can return different builder types so that your early choices condition what your later options are.
1172,1555077413.0719,Leoma,"I like this approach as well. I use it here <https://github.com/z5h/component-result/blob/1.1.0/src/ComponentResult.elm#L73>

Then use it like
```
withModel myModel
        |&gt; withCmd myHttpGet
        |&gt; withCmd myPortCmd
        |&gt; withExternalMsg LoadingData
```"
1172,1555077468.0724,Dede,"Oh yeah, wordiness varies a lot depending on whether you need to keep module prefixing or not.; `builder(requiredParameters) |&gt; setOptA 17 ...` is not so bad."
1172,1555077529.0743,Leoma,"(Ha, I almost always keep the module prefix… Just put down that example to keep it simple)."
1172,1555077558.075,Dede,This is an area where Rust-ish operation-type associations have a code density advantage.; …which may or may not be a readability disadvantage :wink:
1172,1555077670.0756,Rochell,"Readability &gt; all, imo. :slightly_smiling_face:"
1172,1555077722.0757,Leoma,":100: . Although sometimes brevity helps, brevity isn’t necessarily the rule."
1172,1555077775.0759,Nana,but people will always disagree on what is more or less readable :stuck_out_tongue:
1172,1555077779.0761,Rochell,"If brevity is concise and easily readable, then awesome. But if you have to start thinking about how the code is phrased, rather than why it's phrased that way, then it's a stumbling block to understanding. :slightly_smiling_face:; Yeah, that's true enough.; It's an inexact art :slightly_smiling_face:"
1172,1555077847.0767,Nana,"and also, keeping types simple; json-decode-pipeline for example is famously hard for beginners to understand, even though it looks pretty readable"
1172,1555077962.0771,Dede,"The Rust attitude to keeping type simple is to clone the Elm type system, then do a complete tableflip by adding Traits and automatic coercions :wink:; (I spend way more time fighting the type system than the borrow checker, even though the latter is what looks scary at first.)"
1172,1555078158.0777,Jefferson,hello
1173,1555091019.0795,Myrna,Rust just cannot be as easy as Elm
1172,1555091064.0797,Dede,"The non-trait type system is more or less identical to Elm’s type system.  But after that, there’s just a whole lot more stuff."
1173,1555091068.0799,Myrna,"multi-paradigm, lifetime, mixed of side effects; One may think it must be good for a language can do all of this; But it is just opposite. Like C++, for a team using C++, half of team will not understand full spec of the language for just using it, not counting the domain specific problems...; Another example is data and object (opaque data).; Only the clean separation between two can yield a good program.."
1173,1555091382.0811,Dede,"So, I’m enjoying using Rust, and I’m not really interested in a language slag-off.  It’s very different from Elm, serving a different space.  I’ll leave it at that."
1173,1555091453.0813,Myrna,"yeah, it is just my opinion. My main work language is C.; I am just have some rants to what I have seen in the industry code. My bad."
1173,1555091517.0817,Dede,"I find Rust much more tractable than C++ has become.  (I’m also fond of C for its purity of essence., but I’d write in Rust over C because I like the guardrails.)"
1174,1555100877.0848,Emilee,"what do you think has more overhead:
• creating single-rule style tags
• creating custom elements
context: we're currently using custom elements for our svg icons because they are colored with css variables which are not supported in elm. an alternative would be to use pure elm and dynamically create a style tag for every icon defining the css variable
i would like to use a pure elm approach, but i'm worried about the wonkyness and overhead of ad-hoc creating a lot of style tags"
1173,1555101880.0882,Alicia,"<@Emilee> I think there may be a workaround with the CSS variables with
```
Html.Attributes.attribute ""style"" ""--some-var: 10px""
```; we have SVG icons as well, we used `fill: currentColor` for them, and then we wrap them in a span or whatever to set the color; like `span [ class ""w-4 h-4 color-blue"" ] [ Icon.decorativeIcon SomeIconName ]`"
1173,1555103578.0909,Emilee,"hmm, the attribute workaround seems feasible. of course it can accidentally nuke other styles, but that should be avoidable
`currentColor` seems like a better choice for single-color icons than a css variable, but we can't change that right now since parts of our angular codebase depend on the way colors are set at the moment^^"
1175,1555108825.0934,Myrna,"Hi, I constantly feel that structure and presentation are two different respects of a HTML view; mix css style directly inside the code make my html structure very hard to read; Does anyone have suggestion for that situation?; Right now, I use bootstrap classname in the attribute tag for html, and have separate css for it. But bootstrap requires me to modify my html structure as well.."
1175,1555109386.1004,Augustus,"We've been using tailwinds which does utility classes (e.g `p-4 font-semibold color-blue`) , I love it now and try to use as little css as possible. It has a little learning curve but once you are over that development is fluid; Bulma is another one that is similar to tailwinds"
1175,1555109653.102,Myrna,"<@Augustus> I agree, utilities classes are cool; very easy to manipulate as well; but feels like it is kind of abbreviation or alias to write css style attribute in the html, isn't it; of course, shorter, sweater, I looked up the grid css; the two probably can combine together, one for visual layout, the other for visual style"
1176,1555111894.1056,Cornell,Separating layout and style was how `style-elements`(now `elm-ui`) started :smile:
1177,1555138873.1088,Patricia,"I’m actually working on this now. Currently on vacation, but hope to land this in in near future"
1178,1555147568.1098,Hoa,"It’s hard stuff.  I’ve been using CSS since forever and there’s always a bit overlapping.  Bootstrap-like frameworks are  good solution since they do most of the job for you. You pay some price for it though, since they require you write HTML and add cSS classes to match their patterns.  I personally do’t like tailwind-like solutions but they have a lot of fans.  Given that we have flexbox and CSS grids are starting to be more approachable I would think to start with something basic like Normalize.css and  build from there with Sass  and build “components” using BEM like you would in React. So you end up having something like `Card.scss` holding  `Card`, `Card__heading`, `Card__content`, etc.  Utility classes like `text-right` are nice to have. Separate layout and styles may be good too, for theming. Sites like <https://css-tricks.com> gives a lot of insights to cope with HTML/CSS complexity."
1179,1555152685.1144,Jae,"How do you all go about benchmarking elm code? I'm writing a game and the logic running in each animation frame is taking 40ms when it should be less than 16ms.; I know it has to be a CPU bottleneck because there was no performance improvements when I modified my view function to not make an dom changes.; I looked at the performance tab in Chromes dev tools but it just tells me A4, anonymous, and garbage collection are taking most of the time. It doesn't give me any understandable function names; Is my only option to slowly remove different parts of my code until I notice a speedup?"
1179,1555152905.1151,Virgie,the bottom-up tab gives functions with the most self time. you can click on them to go to their definition where you can see the actual name; do you by any chance do record updates in your loop? they are known to be slow
1179,1555153071.1155,Jae,Bottom up looks like this for me.; I probably do have record updates all over the place; The alternative to record updates is to recreate the record manually instead of using the update syntax?
1179,1555153282.1163,Virgie,"yes; try that first, I think that will help a lot. Then the debugger takes a lot of time (so don't do performance measurement while in --debug); perhaps you could let it run for a little while to get more robust numbers"
1179,1555153528.1169,Huong,"Definitely turn off the debugger if you want to have any clue about performance. It serializes the entire state, in a not-super-performant way, on every message. If you have a subscription to animation-frames and non-trivial state, that'll kill performance."
1179,1555153593.1171,Jae,Turning off the debugger completely fixed the issue.
1179,1555153691.1173,Huong,"`--optimize` can also improve performance a bunch, especially when you have lots of boxed types (custom types with a single constructor)"
1179,1555153762.1175,Jae,"True. I want to avoid that though because then I lose hot reloading and Debug.log; In the future, if I have the debugger off and I've avoided using the update syntax inside loops, is there a good way of figuring out what elm functions are taking a lot of CPU time?; I'm worried I'm going to run into performance issues and then have to resort to picking apart my app when trying to find the hot path so I can know what to optimize"
1179,1555154025.1181,Virgie,I've found the bottom up tab to be helpful (click on the blue links/line numbers to go to the actual functions and see their name)
1179,1555154167.1183,Huong,"another useful thing is using what <@Virgie> describes to figure out hot code-paths, picking out the largest offender, benchmarking it and figuring out how to optimize that. If you ever get to that point, feel free to poke me and I'll gladly try and help you out!"
1179,1555154311.1185,Jae,"<@Virgie> I looked at that but the links in the bottom up tab but all the functions were to core library functions that get used everywhere. I suppose this might change if I have an actual performance bottleneck in my code and it isn't just the debugger causing problems.; for benchmarking, is it possible to do it in place or do I need to copy the code into something like a unit test? If it's the latter, while I think it will get things done, it will be time consuming"
1179,1555154407.1191,Virgie,"probably, yes. It's not ideal but I don't think elm can easily do better than this. I would like timing for individual functions but with anonymous functions (and the machinery needed to encode those in JS) that is very hard to do"

1179,1555154483.1202,Virgie,"it is however time-consuming to create the benchmarks (and tests, to make sure your new implementation is not only faster but also still correct); but because you profiled beforehand you know it's probably going to be worth it"
1179,1555154660.1206,Timika,"Yeah, there is no replacement for profiling first. :100:"

1188,1555207194.1501,Claretta,Mind if I ask what the challenge is with ports? Implementation issues or is it more related to a desire to distribute the client as a library?; I've written a basic XMPP over websockets server previously so your particular use case is doubly interesting to me. :grin:
1188,1555208085.153,Isaiah,"Management of the connection happens in javascript (like stream resumption) and all stanzas need to be converted to json before being sent through ports, which is a lot of extra work for nothing in return."
1188,1555208673.1532,Claretta,"It seems like it should be possible to just serialize the stanzas to strings in Elm and just push those through the port.

I still need to add a little bit of logic to handle close events, but from what I remember of XMPP, once the port glue is in place, most of the stream state management should be pretty independent of that code.; Although it's certainly possible I've forgotten some details of the protocol."

```; If arrays are supported then I wouldn't need to do so much copy pasting; With this setup I'm able to call WebGL.entity 200 times and since each call draws 20 instances, I can get 4000 instances total.  This is in contrast with 600 WeblGL.entity calls with 1 instance each.; With some benchmarking I imagine I could figure out what is the optimal balance of copy pasting uniforms and calling WebGL but this is good enough for now; (With arrays the code would look like this)

1195,1555264366.1704,Isaiah,I started writing a client library today and it's coming along quickly. I still have a lot to read in the RFCs though.
1192,1555264602.1706,Dorotha,I see
1192,1555264824.1708,Jae,Not a very strong selling point I know. If instancing is supported in WebGL (I'm not entirely sure if it is) then I think it would be much better to support that directly than improve my hack
1196,1555266247.1712,Hoa,That one is the sequel of Elm Graphics :slightly_smiling_face:; Looks really nice.  I was reading the docs the other day; To pick one really depends on what you are after
1196,1555276226.1727,Lorilee,"There certainly are a lot of RFCs. Once you have a foundation, let me know if you could use some help adding to it."
1197,1555290659.1729,Claretta,"I would also be interested in an Elm XMPP library. I don't have any direct use for it now, but I have some project ideas that I might get around to eventually where it would be nice.; <@Isaiah> One thing to watch out for in the RFCs if you haven't caught it already is that the stream initialization process is different for websockets vs vanilla XMPP over TCP.  Websockets open and close with a single stanza, but in vanilla XMPP there's a `stream` element that wraps every other stanza, and maybe other streams also if you need to create a new stream after auth or TLS negotiation.; The websocket version is much easier to deal with, IMO; I forget what BOSH does."
1198,1555294072.1737,Isaiah,"Here is the start of [elm-xmpp](<https://github.com/ericnething/elm-xmpp>). Figuring out the correct API from Elm is fun, if not a bit challenging. :grin:"
1197,1555294162.1739,Isaiah,<@Claretta> thanks for the heads up. Luckily we have the rfc for [xmpp over websockets](<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7395/?include_text=1>). BOSH is long-polling.
1197,1555296410.1742,Claretta,"Yep, nice. In my project I started with direct XMPP via TCP support and had to deal with all of the nested stream negotiations and it was a huge pain. Then when I got to rfc7395, I was simultaneously thrilled that the process was so much better and annoyed that I had to now have two different mechanisms."
1199,1555303224.1745,Lesli,Thanks <@Lynne>
1200,1555316966.175,Corinne,"&gt; So `instanceOffsets[instanceIndex]` isn't possible. Only things like `instanceOffsets[5]` is supported (which is useless here).

I think there are some hacks you can do here at least <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30585265/what-can-i-use-as-an-array-index-in-glsl-in-webgl>"
1201,1555320064.1796,Rosario,"I'm making a little asteroids-like game just for fun. I think I'll go with timjs' library: there doesn't seem to be a way to place the origin of a polygon in its center in elm-canvas. I want to be able to control the origin so that when I rotate a polygon it rotates about its center of mass without me having to translate it or whatever.

It also seems a bit easier to compose things in in elm-collage.; <@Hoa> ^^"
1201,1555320218.1831,Dorotha,<@Rosario> Have you considered using svg directly? Also welcome to <#C0K5RJ7LN|gamedev> if you’re not there already :)

1202,1555325216.1887,Desire,can somebody recommend a library for typescript that does elm style json decoding?
1202,1555325691.1888,Jae,"Thanks. If lists were supported, I could probably do something like then

uniform vec2 instanceOffsets[20];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++)

    gl_Position = perspective * camera * rotation * vec4(position + vec3(offset, 0), 1.0);

1203,1555329042.192,Gertrude,not in this case it seems. :disappointed:
1203,1555329050.1922,Lynne,"`create-elm-app` does turn on debugging depending on `ELM_DEBUGGER` environment variable:

1203,1555329131.1933,Lynne,If you use it there is a workaround but it requires building elm compiler from source; Yep
1203,1555329146.1937,Gertrude,blargh. that's a bummer.
1203,1555329178.1939,Jae,"As an alternative to the built in debugger, you can try this. <https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-monitor>"

1203,1555329349.1952,Lynne,"Wait, are you talking about `create-elm-app`?; `elm-monitor` does seem being a complicated solution; Another option is to ditch `Gizra/elm-all-set` as it is basically a wrapper of `AssocList`; Plenty of choices for you :slightly_smiling_face:"
1203,1555329539.196,Gertrude,"Well, but that depends if the issue is in the set wrapper or in AssocList"

1203,1555329553.1964,Gertrude,it's the Set part that I need
1203,1555329553.1966,Lynne,Still an option though
1203,1555329566.1968,Nana,yeah you could just use `AssocList.Dict a ()`
1203,1555329566.1971,Lynne,I use AssocList and `--debug` and don't have this issue with building

1203,1555329754.1975,Lynne,Pretty much copy&amp;paste the module; I can hardly imagine it changes
1203,1555329770.1979,Nana,I think the bug has to do with creating a `type alias` for a type from another module

I cannot update the `editingWeek` field like this:

202|                     ( { model | editingWeek = Just { week = wk, days = AnySet.empty, entries = [] } }, Cmd.none )

This `Just` call produces:

    Maybe { days : AnySet.AnySet a, entries : List T.Entry, week : Int }

But it should be:

    Maybe T.EditingWeek

Note: The record update syntax does not allow you to change the type of fields.
You can achieve that with record constructors or the record literal syntax.

It looks like the name clash is in your dependencies, which is out of your
control. Elm does not support this scenario right now, but it may be worthwhile.
Please open an issue describing your scenario so we can gather more usage

1212,1555385984.2507,Earlean,<@Erlene> why is it called only once? Can you call it before you start Elm?
1212,1555386054.2514,Erlene,"<@Earlean> yes, I possibly could, but the problem is I need its value somewhere deep inside. Passing that all the time is annoying.; Basically what this is is calculating the size of the horizontal scrollbar.; The javascript does that by inserting an element, measuring the scrollbar, and removing the element from the DOM again; Not something I can see myself doing in Elm. And it needs to be done once, not all the time I'm drawing elements that need to know this stuff.; <@Kris> hmm, replacing code won't work for me, although it's an interesting technique.

module Widgets exposing (init, Widgets)

type alias Widgets = {
  button: ButtonOptions -&gt; Button,

1225,1555445353.3312,Isaiah,the current ones have an `elm.json` instead of an `elm-package.json` since 0.19 was released. Or are you saying there are deprecated packages showing up on the <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> site?

1229,1555451852.3375,Jeanene,anyone have tips on migrating elm/http 1.0 -&gt; 2.0?
1230,1555453411.3383,Kathryn,Does anyone know how to configure Rails webpacker 4 to compile for production?
1229,1555453454.3384,Jeanene,kinda--what’s your issue?; I’m mainly stuck around converting `Http.expectJson decoder` -&gt; `Http.expectJson Cmd decoder`…
1231,1555460497.3389,Augustus,"The important but there is that the runtime will send the response through your update loop at using the `Cmd` in your example. So if your decoder returns a `FooBar` you would want to pass in a `Msg` constructor that is a `Result Error FooBar`; Like `type Msg = GotFooBar (Result Http.Error FooBar)`, you would use `GotFooBar` as the `Cmd`; Sorry, after re-reading your question I see you probably know all that...in our app we made a wrapper around `Http.task` that handles retries and stuff for us and we use our decoders we had in Http 1.0.0"
1229,1555465945.3397,Jeanene,"Yeah…can you share how you used task? I’m at a total loss right now.; ```
delete : Endpoint -&gt; Cred -&gt; Body -&gt; Decoder a -&gt; Cmd a
delete url cred body decoder =
    Endpoint.request
        { method = ""DELETE""
        , url = url
        , expect = Http.expectJson decoder
        , headers = [ credHeader cred ]
        , body = body
        , timeout = Nothing
        , withCredentials = False
        }
```
For example--expectJson wants `#Decoder a -&gt; Expect msg#`…"
1231,1555478669.3401,Augustus,"I think the only thing you have to add is another param for the `Msg` you want to generate, like
```
delete : Endpoint -&gt; Cred -&gt; Body -&gt; Expect msg -&gt; Cmd msg
delete url cred body expect =
    Endpoint.request
        { method = ""DELETE""
        , url = url
        , expect = expect
        , headers = [ credHeader cred ]
        , body = body
        , timeout = Nothing
        , withCredentials = False
        }
```

Then you can pass in a `Http.expectJson SomeMsg yourDecoder` for the `expect` param; you could also pass in the decoder and `Msg` separately, but I think it is easier to read using this way"

1240,1555531298.3588,Wendell,How do people connect to AWS RDS via Elm? I found ktonon/elm-aws-core but it looks like it hasn’t been updated for 0.19 yet.; I suppose I could just make Http requests but wondering if there is something nicer for querying.
1240,1555531794.3607,Alicia,"<@Wendell> I would do it from the server side rather than on the front end, to do it on the frontend you’d need to give the client side credentials to hit the database and they wouldn’t be secret there; it is likely CORS preventing it, you have to use `withCredentials` to pass them <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials>
And the server you are connecting to has to return an `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header saying that it is OK"
1240,1555532838.3621,Wendell,Yeah that’s a good point. I’ve been trying to test the limits of serverless but this might be pushing it too far.
1241,1555534542.3636,Alicia,"I’m not familiar with doing it in serverless, but I’m sure something similar to what you can do on AWS is possible, there you’d have an API gateway with some routes set up to call your lambda function, and then the lambda function could run the actual query"

1242,1555536896.3651,Huong,"This problem _seems_ simpler than it is. There are multiple ways to represent the same string in bytes - utf8, utf-16, utf-32, ...; so you have to pick a binary representation, and then xor. Then there's the issue that the result may no longer be a valid representation of a string; So what I'd probably do, is, use something like <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/zwilias/elm-utf-tools/latest>, pick a representation, turn both strings into the same type of bytes, `List.map2 Bitwise.xor` them, and finally try to turn the result into a string again"

1250,1555613893.4293,Kris,`a |&gt; f` is literally `f a`; and `g &lt;&lt; f = \x -&gt; g (f x)`
1256,1555618728.4304,Margo,`elm: Map.!: given key is not an element in the map` anyone got a tip?
1256,1555618752.4306,Kris,known compiler bug; I think you have to remove your elm-stuff dir/not compile with --debug
1256,1555618883.4314,Margo,"OK, ill try. Thanks; Im using Parcel and just deleted elm-suff and ran parcel build (not sure what parcel does...). That did not help"
1256,1555619704.4331,Carman,Make sure you're running with Parcel 1.10 since it doesn't use the `--debug` flag
1256,1555619730.4335,Margo,OK
1256,1555619787.4344,Carman,"BTW Parcel is a build manager. It compiles your Elm, handles assets, environment variables, etc for you. It's like Webpack but with no config needed. It also comes with a live-reload server.; You can think of it as a fancier `elm reactor`"
1256,1555619956.4351,Agustin,"Such things always make me sceptical; Config is *always* needed; Usually claims of “no config needed” means the necessary config is hard.; And they don’t play well with others.; Webpack for all its evils, is easily configurable, and integrates with multiple backend frameworks."
1256,1555620374.4374,Erlene,<@Carman> is parcel specific for Elm? Or independent?

1257,1555621235.4412,Chae,Is there any way to do something like `Html.Events.preventDefaultOn` on the window? Such as a subscription? I need to be able to handle form and button navigation with only arrow keys. I have to be able to support a keyboard that doesn’t have a Tab key
1256,1555621657.4417,Nana,<@Chae> `Browser.Events.onKeyPress` ?
1257,1555621769.442,Nana,though I guess it doesn't prevent default
1257,1555621820.4428,Chae,That `prevent default` is the 1 missing part that I need :confused:
1257,1555621921.4433,Nana,I guess you could just add an event listener in JS
1257,1555622096.4447,Chae,"I’m not sure that would work though, as I need to conditionally call `event.preventDefault()` based on elm state"
1256,1555629207.4458,Millie,<@Chae> I had this question yesterday and could solve it ;) <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C0CJ3SBBM/p1555540089368200?thread_ts=1555540089.368200&amp;cid=C0CJ3SBBM>; AMA if you need further help ;)
1256,1555629677.451,Chae,"I'm doing something similar. There's still the possibility of someone changing the focus outside of the outermost div though, in which case the listener no longer works. For example if the body of the app gets focus, there's no way to regain focus inside the app without a mouse or pressing Tab"
1256,1555629901.4523,Millie,"I think this is a workaround for missing core functionality. Not too happy with it, but currently the best option I could find.; The gizra docs also mention adding an `id` to potentially set the focus programmatically. So one could set the focus as a fallback, when it's lost. But it won't make the solution simpler."
1258,1555665036.4587,Hiedi,"Hi, just added `prikhi/decimal` to my project to deal with decimal (obvsly) but now (the first time it compiled with one module using `Decimal`) I get this error `elm: Map.!: given key is not an element in the map`.

1258,1555665163.4595,Sharon,"It happens a lot when you compile with `--debug`, try without it?"
1258,1555665450.4612,Earnest,"<@Hiedi> I might be able to fix that. Can you try the following for me?
1. Open up `~/.elm/0.19.0/package/prikhi/decimal/2.0.0/src/Decimal.elm`
2. Remove the `type alias Mantissa = BigInt` line
3. Replace the `Mantissa` in the type definition for `Decimal` with `BigInt`
4. Remove your project's `elm-stuff` folder
5. Try recompiling w/ the `--debug` flag; If that works I can update the library and push out a new release for you; Not sure if directly editing files in `~/.elm` will work or not though..."
1258,1555665716.4623,Hiedi,Okay I'm trying; First it works without the --debug flag; <@Earnest> Your change does not enable to build with the debug flag; But it works without
1258,1555666342.4644,Earnest,"Hmm, ok thanks for checking. I thought that bug was cause by unexported type aliases or something like that :thinking_face:"
1258,1555666746.465,Hiedi,I guess I just gonna have to wait for 0.19.1 since it seems like a fix is on its way
1259,1555667594.4652,Virgie,you need to remove more; in `~/.elm/0.19.0/package/prikhi/decimal/2.0.0/` there are also some .dat files which you need to remove to get it to actually recompile
1258,1555667764.4669,Hiedi,"<@Virgie> Ok thx, I will try it but I can actually wait for the problem to be fixed since it seems it's really close and since decimal is a small part of my app I can do later"

1263,1555686013.4723,Huong,It looks like gitbook is having some issues
1263,1555688469.4728,Hoa,"Looks up now, at least here."
1263,1555688871.4745,Vilma,"is there a way to combine an HTTP request and some other message in such a way that first the message is sent and then the HTTP request performed? Something like this:

```
Msg = GoingToPerformARequest

send GoingToPerformARequest

```; I think I did something like this once"
1263,1555689503.4777,Jerilyn,"I see that there’s a Json.Decode.maybe. Is there something like that but gives a result instead (Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (Result Error a))?

1264,1555689961.4784,Virgie,"would a `Decoder (List a) -&gt; List (Result Error a)` also work? that is much easier; how you would do that is have a 2-phase decoder, decode first with a `Decoder (List Value)`, then use `decodeValue` on the  items of the list"
1263,1555690185.48,Vilma,"<@Virgie> would you know anything about the question I posted above? :point_up: :pray:; it seems that before the `2.0.0` version of the `elm/http` package this was achieved with `toTask`, but this function no longer exists?"
1263,1555690301.4807,Virgie,there is still <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/Http#task>
1263,1555690331.4811,Vilma,"yes, I saw that but it’s way more complicated and asking for quite a bit of parameters"
1263,1555690474.4821,Virgie,"previously toTask was used in a pipeline, this new function is just one function that does everything without need for pipelines"
1263,1555690478.4822,Vilma,and that `Resolver` parameter which the documentation does not make it very clear what it should be used for
1263,1555690557.4828,Virgie,it maps a response to a result. This means you have to handle all the failure cases of a `Response` up-front
1263,1555691208.4831,Vilma,sometimes I just feel like I don’t get the Elm architecture :sweat:
1263,1555691514.4848,Hoa,Indeed previously it was simpler to concatenate two tasks together: ` ... |&gt; Http.toTask  |&gt; Task.andThen ...`  I have yet to see if this can be mapped directly with the new API
1263,1555691533.4852,Vilma,I’ve been trying for a bit now but I just can’t figure it out; the old `Http.toTask` function seemed to be very user-friendly and easy to understand and use; I just can’t see another way to achieve what I’m trying without something similar; because I want to send a message which will set some flags (e.g. loading flag to true) before the HTTP request runs
1263,1555691768.4881,Hoa,"There was some discussion about this limitation, but I don’t remember which solutions came up.  I believe there was a package that builds on the new HTTP package which makes easier to deal with the kind of issues."
1263,1555691781.4883,Vilma,I’m going to take a look
1263,1555691949.4888,Hoa,<@Vilma> Should be this:  <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jinjor/elm-req/latest/>; (Found out on Elm Discourse); Some context: <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/using-task-to-send-http-requests/2696>
1263,1555692052.4896,Vilma,thanks <@Hoa> going to read into this; but even then from what I’ve read it seems creating a custom Cmd Msg is not ideal because it will be run twice via de runtime?
1263,1555692633.4904,Hoa,Lemme see.
1263,1555692641.4907,Vilma,"<https://medium.com/elm-shorts/how-to-turn-a-msg-into-a-cmd-msg-in-elm-5dd095175d84>; &gt; 1. Cmd Msg* is inefficient
&gt; By creating your own Cmd Msg you are making 2 trips through the elm runtime. Which is unnecessary. The command you are sending out, will end up in some other branch of our update function.; then it recommends either calling `update` recursively or passing the message directly in the `update` branch you are in; I think I can do that but will involve me doing some changes to my app"
1263,1555692793.4922,Hoa,"Ah, that one is a classic; But wait,  you have to use the Elm runtime to do a HTTP call.; The basic idea is that, instead of doing two calls and manage two `Cmd`’s  you combine two (or more) tasks and finally manage a single `Cmd`."

1266,1555703208.4962,Buffy,"Anyone in here familiar or have any examples (besides rogeriochavez/spades boilerplate) of using elm-return to slim down an `update` function?; Whoah this is interesting...

1266,1555705485.4976,Allyn,"I don’t see anything special, it looks like the default app. Am I missing something?"
1266,1555705515.4978,Buffy,"Msg is a record instead of a sum.; I realized it's a bad idea in the process tho because the view has to construct the whole record which is the opposite of what I'm trying to do...
That or you have to pass in `Msg` to the view function which felt backwards too.
I went back to a sum type.; Anyone ever tried modeling `Msg -&gt; Model` with a Result type?"
1267,1555714996.0016,Ashton,Yes. Some people have done that.
1266,1555715049.0027,Buffy,"Any examples? I'm trying to make ""Impossible States"" in my update instead of defaulting to a `_ -&gt; ...` case."
1266,1555715088.0041,Ashton,"Personally I havent seen much value in the approach, but I know at least a few people seem quite satisfied doing it."
1266,1555715248.0077,Buffy,"When you case against a pair you get Msg * Model number of states, but with an Either it'd be Msg + Model states which should map better to what I'm trying to do.
Well I might need a regular Sum instead of an either.
You can see an example of something close to what I'm doing with <https://github.com/rogeriochaves/spades/blob/master/boilerplate/src/Update.elm#L21>
Only I want to get rid of the defaulting that's required to ""ignore"" all the other page states by modeling the whole orchestration as a Sum instead of a Product.
<https://github.com/rogeriochaves/spades/blob/master/boilerplate/src/Update.elm#L21>"
1266,1555715298.0092,Ashton,"Yeah, <@Leoma> has a return package that treats updates as returing a result-y kind of thing, which may error. I recall someone at my local Elm meet up showing off a big application where every update returned a `Result Error (Model, Cmd Msg)`; I guess Im a critic of this, so I would much rather convince you not to follow this way than help connect you with them. For example, at least on the theoretical argument of “making impossible states impossible”, I dont think `Msg`/`Model` combinations are impossible states.; 0 At least in my book, a `Msg` isnt a state. Its not memory that persists over time. It doesnt stay in your application. Its just a fleeting report of something that happened that your application needs to respond to.
1 Its a lot more possible than you might think. `Msg` come from the outside world. You dont know when or where they are coming from. Weird combinations can happen. I know this, in part, because I and others have put analytics in our applications that report impossible states that we _thought_ were impossible."
1266,1555715806.0191,Buffy,"First of all, I totally understand where you're coming from (or at least I think we understand each other).
Therefor, I'm really modeling this as a Product of Sums, where ""Outside"" messages are a part of the top level product, but then I want to mitigate someone's ability to something like `onClick Login` if they're already logged in, yeh?

EG: I have a `type Model = Authentication {email : String, password: String} | Main {name: String, etc : }` and a `type Msg = Authentication CredsMsg | Main MainMsg` and I'm trying to have an update that looks something like
```
update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg mdl =
   case ??? of
      Authentication message, Authentication model -&gt;
      Main message, Main model -&gt;
```
which I have a version of that using a Tuple but then the compiler yells at me about not covering the `Authentication _, Main _` and `Main _, Authentication _` cases which are what I'm trying to avoid because they don't make sense.; I hope what I'm saying makes sense... happy to paste a larger snippet if it'd be useful?"
1266,1555715952.0199,Ashton,"I think I hear you.; I think its okay to just have a case that goes to nothing happening. So, just in pure practical terms, I think:
```
    (MainMsg subMsg, Authneitcation authModel) -&gt;
        (model, Cmd.none)
```
is an okay to way to go."
1266,1555716218.0247,Buffy,"The Tuple is the problem algebraically speaking... yes I _could_ use a `_ -&gt; ...` to just ignore the bad cases at runtime... and it'd work but then if me or someone comes along later the compiler won't yell at us if we try to add a case like `(Authentication _, Main _) -&gt; -- This case should be impossible to even construct`.; `(a, b)` means there's `a * b` number of cases so if a and b are both type `Bool` that's 4 cases. But if I use a Sum of Bools ala:
```
type MsgModelThingMaybe = Auth Bool | Main Bool
```
The you have `Auth + Main` which is only two constructors to case on. `|` is type speak for addition algebraically speaking. Where a Tuple or an anonymous Product is type speak for multiplication."
1266,1555716556.0304,Ashton,"Yeah also I like to avoid `_ -&gt;`. And to avoid incompleteness, you could just write out some of the non-sense cases. I think for practical purposes that could be the best way to handle this.; Im still reluctant to call these combinations “nonsense” or “impossible”. They could happen. Maybe extremely rarely. Maybe theres no reason to handle them. But its still there. Its a logical possibility, and a very remote and trivial real possibility."
1266,1555719414.0344,Buffy,"Man loopty loop... I think for now I'm gonna settle on `Debug.todo` in that case that ""shouldn't"" exist. Oh bother... :bear: :honey_pot:"
1268,1555720435.0354,Dede,A key thing is that messages are asynchronous and can show up late.  So “impossible” stuff can happen pretty easily.  
1266,1555720866.0378,Buffy,"I'm aware messages are asynchronous at least in principle, what I'm asking about arises from me trying to learn <@Willodean>/elm-return lib...
I just searched it on the packages site and <@Ashton> you have a similar package...
What I'm trying to do (maybe without the whole Lens thing) is this... <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/toastal/return-optics/latest>
But that's 0.18 and hasn't been upgraded it seems."
1268,1555720914.0386,Buffy,<@Myrtle> isn't using a `_ -&gt; ...` in examples from what I can tell...
1266,1555720955.04,Willodean,What is the challenge?
1266,1555721003.0409,Buffy,"Trying to use you're lib to facilitate composition of updates without resorting to a `_ -&gt; Debug.todo` case...; I started down this path following the spades boilerplate but every child component has a default case that NoOp's and I want to make those cases incorrect by construction.; Want to avoid -&gt; <https://github.com/rogeriochaves/spades/blob/master/boilerplate/src/Cats/Update.elm#L25>; If you scroll to the bottom of the README here apparently there's a way to do it?
<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/toastal/return-optics/latest>; But that package isn't updated to 0.19 and I'm also not super sure I should need Lenses to accomplish this?; That make any sense?"
1266,1555721246.0439,Willodean,"You can't; You are going to have a Noop case; Either you just don't have that case, or you do.; If you do, you do. Period; Also, don't use `_ -&gt;` in pattern matches; Enumerate or lose exhaustivity checks"
1266,1555721361.0468,Buffy,"This is what I'm trying to avoid.; I'm trying to enumerate. But a Tuple (Anonymous Product, etc...) is algebraic multiplication and it's causing more states than are valid for my use case but trying to tie the Msg and Models together in a Sum is not working like I'm expecting it too.; Is this relevant? <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/bChiquet/elm-accessors/latest/Accessors-Library>"
1266,1555721877.0487,Willodean,Ahh; You have numerous invalid cases due to space routing; You are fucked bro; The answer to this problem is injective type families or associated data families; You can do this in Haskell but you are fucked in Elm
1266,1555722120.055,Buffy,"Not sure what you mean by ""space routing"" and I've read through Sandi McGuire's Type Level programming book but haven't written anything with HKD or Type Families yet so still not super sure how they'd solve this problem.

Turning the function algebra into a Sum seems to be what I'm trying to do but I don't even know what I'm saying too... Ugh... I'm such a tweener right now it's painful.; Clearly you can turn a `a -&gt; b` into a Product ala `(a, b)` but not sure how to then say I only want `(Int, Int) | (Bool, Bool)` and not also `(Int, Bool) | (Bool, Int)`... :confused:; I tried parameterizing the type constructor but that ended up polluting a bunch of shit `type ActionModel a b c d = PageOne a b | PageTwo c d` and didn't seem to do what was in my head.; Plus `PageOne a b` is just another way of saying `(a, b)` anyways so I knew it wasn't right."
1266,1555722499.0602,Willodean,They solve this problem because you can parameterize the second type by the first; Or having them share a type; I meant SPA routing; Consider we have 3 types; A route type; A model type; And a msg type
1266,1555722603.0631,Buffy,With yah so far :slightly_smiling_face:
1266,1555722670.0649,Willodean,update :: Msg (route :: Route) -&gt; Model (route :: Route) -&gt; Model (route :: Route); Now we are guaranteed that everything lines up; You can't do this in Elm
1266,1555722765.067,Buffy,See my brain is trying to write that like `update : Msg Route -&gt; Model Route -&gt; Model Route` but that's not a thing right? But why?
1266,1555722809.0676,Willodean,Because we want Route promoted or it gives us nothing
1266,1555722920.0685,Buffy,Phantom types don't help here? I mean I can think of why it should work in my head but I can't see why it can't / won't work in Elm.
1266,1555723036.0694,Willodean,Right; Because you want this as the concrete case; `Model 'PageOne`; Not; `Model Route`; To make matters worse you will need to existentialize and deexistentialize to convince the compiler you are right about this; `forall` is an issue
1266,1555723286.0752,Buffy,"I think the intuition of it is starting to make sense in my brain now... in other words, in Elm we're sorta just stuck with the `a x b` Tuple and `Debug.todo` crashing out if a bad case ever gets hit, yeh?

So where do Lenses fit into this whole thing?
Like how's this happening?
<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/toastal/return-optics/latest>
Or is it just irrelevant?"
1266,1555723351.0756,Willodean,"irrelevant; frankly this is a problem that is a legit use case for dependent types; however I would suggest that `Debug.todo` is a shitty answer; My advice is to detect the case, no `_ -&gt; ` and write to an error holder on your model; that way you can do something with the error, like send it to a port or show it to the user"
1266,1555723561.0789,Buffy,Or re-write the thing in something with HKT? Purescript? Does purescript have something like elm-ui? That's the lib that keeps me stuck on elm at the moment?
1266,1555723591.0793,Willodean,"HKT is not the issue; the problem is you need to convince the compiler that unaligned cases are impossible; that means that you need some for of dependent typing; where the type of the function can be determined by the value of its input; PureScript cannot do this either, unless they added existentials recently; haskell can only barely do this; and even then, its not ergonomic; the truth is you are running down the type level road, and that road lies maddness; you can invest hours upon hours of effort convincing the compiler this wont happen, and in practice have eliminated ZERO bugs"
1266,1555723785.0844,Buffy,"Yeh, I get the picture. So for now, just `Debug.todo` then upgrade that to something to track if the app ever hits any of these cases... maybe by then something else will exist that handles this sort of thing nicer?"

In other words, I can't really think of a way of handling this that doesn't involve manually parsing the actual json string; Or to explain it slightly differently - Elm internally uses `JSON.parse(jsonString)` because it's much more efficient to do that than to implement a custom parser. The issue in this case is that, on the resulting value, there is - as far as I can think of - no way to say whether the original JSON string specified `2.0` or just `2`; (i.e. in JS, `2.0 === 2`); so to disambiguate, it would have to happen during parsing rather than during decoding, which we currently do not control"

I guess this is the same approach used by Imba which has great performance too. <http://imba.io>   Here there’s a related discussion: <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/an-alternative-to-virtual-dom-20x-faster/2264>
1292,1556004758.1886,Earlean,"Google's 'incremental dom' is the same idea. But it requires that you can know the data dependency relationship between data and the view statically at compile time; See their `{#each` syntax, because they can't call a function like `map` to do it and still keep track of data dependencies statically; All flow control in the view needs to be compile time trackable, which means no arbitrary loops or recursion. They achieve this restriction by having a specific template syntax that can only describe that restricted flow control"

1304,1556036680.2481,Huong,"It depends. Certain DOM events will call `update` synchronously and redraw the DOM synchronously afterwards (to prevent the jumping cursor type bugs).

Other events, like an HTTP response coming in, will asynchronously trigger `update`, and `update` will then asynchronously schedule a render.

Ports are (afaik) always triggered synchronously.; Note that a lot of this changed between 0.18 and 0.19, but most of those changes shouldn’t have obvious impact on users, except a few things have now transparently become possible (such as trigger things through a port JS in response to a click event, within the same tick)"

What are the guaranties regarding call order of cmd ports subscriptions on the javascript side?
I have a case where 2 calls of my top-level update function writes to a port. The 1st call also returns a Random.generate. The unexpected behavior is that the data written to my port by the second update is passed to my javascript subscription before the data written by the first update.
I know the commands execution order is not at all guaranteed, but I always thought it applied only to the commands emitted by a single update.
Should I consider the behavior I observe as being normal?"
1306,1556038674.26,Kenya,<@Erlene> You could hash (and possibly base64 encode) the string. That would make for a valid and unique class name.

1312,1556081324.29,Dede,"Got it.  For that, you might want to record the `tracker` strings of the outstanding requests somewhere on the model and call `cancel` on them in `onUrlChange`."
1312,1556081419.2902,Floy,"that would work pretty neat in flat-like TEA

1313,1556089040.2967,Ruthann,"ic, so i have to copy all the dependencies into the main elm.json"
1313,1556089045.2969,Huong,so its dependencies have to be added to the only elm.json elm actually looks at
1313,1556089051.2971,Ruthann,does it matter if it's a direct or indirect dependency?
1313,1556089063.2975,Huong,they need to be direct deps; since your modules use them
1313,1556089123.2988,Ruthann,"cool, thx!"
1313,1556089178.299,Huong,"and, a little plug for the tool I released yesterday - if you were to run `elm-json solve` on the `elm.json` of this Alfred, it would give you a concrete set of versions that should work"
1313,1556089201.2992,Ruthann,O_o!
1313,1556089460.2996,Floy,"that's funny :slightly_smiling_face:
requests created with `Task` you cannot cancel those :confused:; unless it's possible to cancel the task, which I do not know anything about; <@Dede> any thoughts on that?"
1313,1556089521.3002,Ruthann,"so i ran it on the elm.json in the main project and it did the trick
doing it on the elm.json inside the local module doesn't give me the dependencies in the main package"
1313,1556089674.3004,Huong,Correct. I wasn’t very clear - what I meant to say was that you can run in on the `elm.json` of your “local package” to turn those version ranges into concrete versions that you can then install (manually) in your application’s elm.json
1313,1556089811.3007,Ruthann,"cool, thx for that"
1315,1556090020.3011,Floy,"Hey, you cannot cancel `Task`? Or can you ?"
1315,1556090335.302,Earlean,kind of...but not really.
1313,1556090352.3025,Earlean,not in a way that it would be generally useful
1313,1556090382.3031,Floy,"so here's funny thing, at least it was funny for me :wink:
you can try and cancel http request that was done via `Http.request`, but you cannot do that for `Http.task`"
1315,1556090386.3033,Floy,kinda of akward; <@Earlean> do you have an example of doing this in non generally useful way?
1313,1556090733.3047,Floy,"<@Earlean> I am just asking because I am curios :slightly_smiling_face:, it'd be nice to see some hack now and then :smile:"
1315,1556090900.3048,Dayna,"True, but then your business logic stays inside the view, which is what you're trying to avoid."
1315,1556091021.3058,Nana,<@Floy> you can ignore the response
1315,1556091037.3062,Earlean,"<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Process#kill> does it, but it's not really complete"
1315,1556091185.3077,Floy,"<@Nana> I know that, just have been looking for some hints
it's been quite puzzling to analyze that problem in Elm and even more surprising to notice that you can easily cancel `Http.request` but you cannot do the same with `Http.task`

thx <@Earlean>; I wonder if perhaps looking at this, this way I mean, is correct; maybe there is no use case and if use decide to use `Http.task` it is because you do not want this request to be interrupted"
1316,1556091899.3095,Nga,"What's the best approach if I need the higher range of Maybe.maps? Like a Maybe map6, Maybe map7, etc. Should I create those functions, or is there something else I should do?"
1315,1556092001.3096,Maxwell,"<@Alicia> The second gif you posted (ssr2.gif) is more useful because it shows the problem precisely. The nodes *are created twice*. That's why you see the HTML fade in twice.

If elm hydrated DOM nodes, we would see the fade in animation only once, when the browser renders the HTML the first time, which is before elm takes over. When the elm app starts after the timeout, it appears to wipe out out the existing HTML in the selected container and creates the DOM tree from scratch, triggering the fade in animation a second time."
1316,1556092079.31,Nga,I'm trying to map to a record using its constructor.
1315,1556092176.3112,Kris,Look for the andMap function in the extra package 
1316,1556092276.3126,Huong,"You could pull in elm-community/maybe-extra which gives you `andMap`, or define it yourself real quick (`andMap = map2 (|&gt;)`). With that, you can
```Just YourRecord
  |&gt; andMap foo.first
  |&gt; andMap foo.second
  |&gt; ...
```"
1316,1556092340.313,Nga,Thank you both :slightly_smiling_face: I'll give that a shot
1316,1556092742.3133,Carrie,I want to use some of Ace's functions in elm. Is there any good way?
1315,1556094398.3145,Liza,"is the same .. but it depends on your own style
```Maybe.map YourRecord foo.first
  |&gt; andMap foo.second```"
1317,1556098349.3165,Emilee,"hmm, get a runtime error of `TypeError: QA is not a function` in my elm application when it is removed from the dom. I have no idea where the error gets ""QA"" from; ah, it's the minifier; well, that's an embarrassing problem for me to solve...^^'"
1317,1556098737.3206,Shaina,"Is anyone else having problem with Html.textarea and the Grammarly plugin? I'm using Firefox with the Grammarly plugin and the following snippet gives a type error in the console: <https://ellie-app.com/5mzBgtKNrpTa1>. To reproduce without running it locally right-click in the frame with the actual app and click ""This Frame"" -&gt; ""Open Frame in New Tab"", then in the new tab resize the textarea (before clicking in it, giving it focus or writing in it), then click in the textarea and start writing. You'll notice that the reversed string is not being written and that if you go to the JS console you should see a ""TypeError: domNode is undefined""."
1317,1556098818.322,Emilee,"does anyone here have any experience with *removing* an elm app from the dom? i thought i had a good solution, but apparently it still throws errors sometimes (when there is a call to `getElement` running and the element isn't found, it then faceplants when trying to call the error scheduler). this seems to only happen when building optimized though"
1317,1556098878.323,Shaina,It seems like it works in Chrome.
1317,1556099960.3283,Huong,"I responded in <#C0CLGCMMF|testing>. Generally try not to cross post questions, it makes things confusing"
1317,1556100003.3285,Bret,"Sure thing, I just realized <#C0CLGCMMF|testing> was probably a better place to post"
1318,1556100526.3297,Danika,Grammarly and other extensions that mess with the DOM on their own will always run the risk of breaking things like elm 
1318,1556101592.3299,Shaina,"I understand that, but it's really quite unfortunate. I'll try to contact Grammarly, but in the meantime it would be nice if there was something I could do on my end to help fix the problem."
1318,1556101684.3312,Danika,"Not really, the vdom operates on the assumption that nothing else will touch the parts of the real dom it controls. "
1319,1556102805.3348,Lilli,"Hey folks! We released a new stable version of our business product and we're finally moving to elm 0.19 :tada:; I wanted to take this opportunity to split the app into 2 parts, the api/sdk lib and the browser app. How do you setup your project so that you can import a local module instead of installing it from the elm package repo?"
1319,1556102927.3356,Huong,"Actually; ```         , Attr.attribute ""data-gramm_editor"" ""false""

1319,1556103031.3378,Danika,"Well TIL, thats handy! "
1319,1556103184.3381,Shaina,Excellent! Thanks a lot <@Huong>
1319,1556103380.3387,Lynne,I think you can just mention few entries in `source-directories` of `elm.json`; Like `src/browser` and `src/api`
1319,1556103637.3408,Lilli,"i was searching for a `elm.json` syntax/description, but couldn't find any documentation so far (except few things mentioned in the elm official intro)"

1319,1556103678.3416,Lilli,Ah! that's handy :smile: thanks!
1320,1556104928.3423,Corinne,Hmm maybe there should be a JSON Schema defined for this (if there isn't already)
1320,1556105172.3452,Huong,"I don’t think there is, nor do I see who would really be helped by that. If the issue is that creating an `elm.json` file isn’t trivial, I’d have to agree, but I don’t think a schema would help. If you’re interested, though, I released an `elm-json` tool just yesterday that can help with initialising such files (for both applications and packages) as well as with keeping dependencies up to date"
1320,1556105468.3456,Shaina,<https://github.com/zwilias/elm-json> for the curious.; That looks very helpful <@Huong>
1320,1556105732.3477,Corinne,"JSON Schema can be useful if you're editing the file by hand, and your IDE supports schemas.

I too generally prefer a tool to manage the whole process ideally, so might give `elm-json` a try..."
1320,1556106532.3505,Emilee,"elm-json sounds like the tool i've been waiting for (although i think a lot of this functionality should be moved into `elm` at some point).
i think elm doesn't want you editing its `elm.json` by hand, but it's been necessary with 0.19 so far when removing/updating dependencies. a schema might be nice anyway so you can see how the file is supposed to be structured inside your editor"
1321,1556107435.351,Emilee,"Okay, I've looked into this a bit more. The error only happens when elm is set to `optimize` (in webpack), and the error is that it can't find the constructor `elm$browser$Browser$Dom$NotFound` in the `getElement` handler"
1321,1556107562.3513,Huong,"That;s a painful issue, but not an unknown one; let me see if I can find a trace somewhere; <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1836#issuecomment-463037320>"
1321,1556107672.3519,Emilee,"okay, i've got another piece of information: this happens reliably every time in optimized mode when an element is not found (and never in non-optimized mode). so it has nothing to do with our elements being ""unmounted""; that's at least a bit of a relief for me, since it's not just a problem with our weird setup^^; so my current option is basically ""wait and accept that this will happen"" i guess?"
1321,1556108353.3534,Huong,"It _might_ be that there’s some weird edgecase where using `identity` in the right place might incluence the callgraph enough to place its definition first, but I’m honestly not sure!"
1322,1556108428.3542,Tanika,"Hey, is there a solution to prevent Http.multipartBody to encode ""+"" as "" "" in a Http.stringPart ?"
1321,1556108458.3543,Emilee,that is... an interesting proposition XD
1322,1556108649.3551,Rochell,"Anyone know if there's any workaround for this compiler bug? <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1776> (Other than not having conditional subscriptions, I guess, which becomes messy in an SPA)"
1321,1556108797.3553,Emilee,"the question is... where?^^; wait, it needs to be called too, right?"
1321,1556108999.3561,Lynne,Do you send any command from your `init` <@Rochell>?
1322,1556109013.3564,Rochell,"Yeah, the initial routing in the SPA happens there."
1321,1556109057.357,Lynne,Is it generated as a result of `Task.attempt` or `Task.perform`?
1321,1556109058.3572,Rochell,"And since each page has its own subscriptions, that's where the conditional subscriptions happen; No, doesn't use Task."
1321,1556109100.3575,Emilee,"okay, doing this doesn't seem to help
```
main =
    Application.element
        { init = identity init -- The call to `identity` is just here to temporarily fix #2901. It should be removed when Elm 0.19.1 hits
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , propDecoder = propDecoder
        }
```"
1321,1556109121.3577,Rochell,"But it does change the model such that the subscriptions change, since each page in the SPA has its own subscriptions."
1321,1556109129.3579,Emilee,i think i'll just accept that the error message will be here for a while^^'
1321,1556109135.3581,Lynne,"Ok, you do something like `Navigation.pushUrl`, right?"
1321,1556109136.3583,Rochell,"Which, if I'm reading the bug report right, would trigger this issue."
1321,1556109138.3585,Huong,"Yeah, I don’t think it’s currently fixable :confused:"
1321,1556109139.3587,Rochell,Yeah
1321,1556109153.3589,Lynne,I think you may try delaying this using `Process.sleep`
1321,1556109184.3591,Rochell,Hmm... okay. Is it a race condition?
1321,1556109190.3593,Lynne,"There were examples where it helped (presumingly by allowing runtime to initialize subscriptions subsystem correctly); Yeah, seems like that; But those example was with a task, so I am not sure it will help you; Still may be worth trying"
1321,1556109228.3601,Rochell,"Yeah, never know. Any idea how long to sleep for?"
1321,1556109234.3603,Lynne,Start with 1ms
1321,1556109272.3605,Rochell,I'll give it a go. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks.
1321,1556109281.3607,Lynne,Good luck :slightly_smiling_face:
1321,1556109287.3609,Rochell,That's got bad code smell all over it though lol
1321,1556109331.3611,Lynne,"Well, that's life... I usually add some comment saying why it had to be done this way and what I am working around; Gives a relief :slightly_smiling_face:"
1321,1556109350.3615,Rochell,Haha. At least pushing responsibility back to the compiler. :wink:
1321,1556109369.3618,Lynne,"Well, but that's where it belongs, tbh"
1321,1556109524.362,Rochell,"Yeah, definitely. I just want to find an elegant way past the problem. Life's not always fair. :wink:"

1335,1556189104.42,Loida,Does anybody understand why in `Http` package id for tracking is a string supplied by the consumer? What would be the behaviour in case in different parts of the program same string gets accidentally supplied? Why won’t `Http.request` just return the opaque id which would be guaranteed to be unique?; I am wondering if it was an intentional decision due to some use cases or just an accident
1335,1556189253.4206,Earlean,Given that it's a pure function...how would it get this unique id?
1335,1556189475.4208,Loida,Http module is stateful <https://github.com/elm/http/blob/2.0.0/src/Http.elm#L953-L961>. The id can be just an int which starts from 0 and gets increased on each request creation.; Or it can be the `Process.Id`
1335,1556189733.4212,Earlean,So if I made two calls to `Http.request`with the same parameters I would get two different results?; or two results that were equal but actually different?
1335,1556189780.4216,Loida,"You do get 2 different commands, don’t you?"
1335,1556189915.4219,Earlean,"no, it's a pure function. You get the same result for the same parameters; I can make two calls to `Http.request` with the same parameters, ignore the return value of the second call and return the result of the first call to the runtime twice in a Cmd.batch and the result will be the same; All functions in Elm are referentially transparent (at least from the perspective of your Elm code)"
1335,1556190354.4225,Loida,"<https://ellie-app.com/5n3LY26BBY7a1>; It’s a function, not a data. And you can’t compare functions. I understand it as commands are not equal."

1335,1556190533.4231,Loida,Not sure I see how this is different from having `Id` for which equality does not work.
1335,1556190568.4233,Earlean,the cmds are interchangable even if you can't check them for equality; the `Id` would also need to be interchangable; which means that the problem you're address still exists

1341,1556218471.0168,Dayna,You will need to construct a Grid value when you call the gridAttributes function. If you define a custom type and export it with `(..)` other modules can import it and call any of the constructors of the Grid type to get a value

Anyone here have a use case where they've done something with the model in a subscription function?"
1366,1556404804.0979,Huong,"I don’t have code-examples handy, but one example I can offer is that we add a `keydown` subscription when a modal is open, so we can close it when `escape` is pressed; we could have the subscription always be there and filter in the model, too; but then that’s always the case, I suppose - ignoring the message based on the state, or not subscribing to the event based on the state, it’s just a matter of how much work needs to happen"
1367,1556405434.1011,Buffy,I wish I followed that but maybe YAGNI till I do for now?; The other thing I'm curious about is if subscriptions can be attached if you're expecting a response of some sort from them and otherwise don't bother the run time? Not sure if that makes any sense.
1366,1556405803.1035,Huong,"Yeah, that’s basically what the `Model -&gt;` part is for - based on your model, you can decide whether you are interested in receiving certain events, and hence, subscribe to those events"
1367,1556405865.1037,Naoma,"An example of why you might need `model` is if you have a specific page in your app where you want to track time passing, but you don’t care about it otherwise. One solution is you could have a value in `model` that lets `subscriptions` know whether it should subscribe to `Time.every` or not. While you could just run the event all the time regardless and filter out what you don’t need in `update`, I feel `subscriptions` is a better place for it because: 1. you’re only running `update` constantly when necessary; and 2. it separates the logic of “do I care about this subscription?” from “how should I update my model and what effects need to happen?”"

1373,1556480943.122,Isaias,Is there a discussion thread somewhere <@Huong>?
1373,1556481417.1222,Huong,"There is a meta-issue that tracks a number of tickets related to more flexibility for `comparable` types, of which custom types is only a small part. As per usual, the goal is to (eventually) find a holistic design rather than solving just the immediate issue, thereby possibly excluding other options in the future (or making them harder to add) - <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1008>; Various designs have been proposed and discussed, like “use the definition order” - which has significant downsides, or a bespoke `data module where { type = .., compare = .., eq = .. }` syntax for making data-type modules that would allow making them comparable and allow overriding structural equality, but that also has significant downsides. I’m sure there have been others, though. The point is mostly this:
- this is not an easy issue
- making a decision means committing to a particular design, to the exclusion of other options
- this does not have the highest priority right now, as there are workaround for most immediate issues stemming from the limited `comparable` type variable"
1373,1556483302.1227,Isaias,Ok thanks for the detailed response
1374,1556483829.1298,Isaias,"Ontological question: Suppose you have types `A` and `B`, and `A` has an `A.fromB` constructor.

Say you want to also make `B`'s from `A`'s. Do you make a `B.fromA` constructor or an `A.toB` deconstructor?"
1373,1556483842.1299,Huong,"(I realize it might not be obvious what downsides there are to using definition order, so just to give an example - this means that if I write a library that exposes a datatype that happens to be implemented as a custom type, people might rely on the sorting order. Changing the order would then suddenly affect consumers of my library. That would be surprising and definitely lead to issues. Things would be even worst if my type is opaque - the user can’t even see what order things will be sorted in, but that implementation detail now leaks. There are arbitrary ways to limit the impact - only make simple enumerations `comparable` and/or require that the constructors be exposed - but that obviously complicates the design and means people will still ask for `comparable` custom types :smile: TL;DR: it means leaking implementation details, which is tricky business); I usually prefer `toFoo` functions, and always feel a little bad writing `String.fromInt` or `String.fromFloat` :smile: (this was for me also a point of confusion while learning Rust. While using `.into()` is a common pattern there, this is usually done by implementing a `From&lt;T&gt;` trait on the target type, rather than an `Into&lt;T&gt;` trait on the originating type)"
1374,1556484688.1329,Isaias,why do you prefer that?
1374,1556484908.1343,Huong,"Consistency, mostly. For whatever reason, it also matches my mental model better - I’m more likely to think “I want to turn X into Y” rather than “I want to create a Y from an X”"
1374,1556486763.1352,Isaias,"Ah, the ""source-path-goal"" image schema :laughing:"

1376,1556519698.1414,Earlean,<@Bethel> first you need to write a `String -&gt; Maybe Unit` function

1376,1556519846.144,Earlean,"`TemperatureSetting` is a constructor for the type `Setting`, it takes a String and a Unit and gives you a `Setting`; `Json.map2` takes a function as it's first parameter"

1377,1556524479.1473,Lynn,"in brief, you cannot, as Elm lists have to contain all the same type.; you’ll need to use a CustomType to express the variations that you have; ah, sorry, read more carefully; `Decode.field ""age"" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int> |&gt; Decode.maybe |&gt; Decode.list |&gt; Decode.map (List.filterMap identity)`"

it's not really polished yet either, as i've never taken the time to really write it down"
1378,1556526545.1507,Millie,"To decode all content of the list, maybe <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#oneOf> could help; If there is the possibility, I'd change the API model instead and go with a dict/object to tackle the root cause."
1378,1556526759.151,Huong,"There’s an additional point, actually: perhaps “custom types being comparable” is an XY-problem! Perhaps the most common reason for this request is people who wish to make a `Dict` or `Set` with custom types - in that case, them being comparable is a prerequisite for that to be possible. However, that’s not the only possible resolution - there is ongoing work for making hashmaps (and hashsets) a thing, and those would not require a `comparable` constraint."
1378,1556527221.1512,Emilee,"yeah, i also approached the issue differently. in my concept i'd try to move away from implicit typeclasses like `comparable`
what i was thinking is that typeclasses always have the side effect of making things implicit, but elm a lot of the time is about making things explicit.
when we look at a typical problem of ""i want to have a sorted datastructure"" the explicit method - passing the comparison function - has one of two poblems:
• either we have to pass the function with every operation, which is clumsy and also error prone
• or we have to put the function in the data structure, which makes it hard to work with in the model
*but*: what if you could put the function in the type?
i'm not exactly sure yet how this would be best implemented to maintain readability in elm, but if you could annotate your type with a function, you could have a `SortedDict (sortFunc : a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) a` or something.
This would, I think, cover most cases where people with a background in haskell would reach for typeclasses, and still maintain explicitness.
A major issue here is how it interacts with the existing syntax, and how to make it clear when we talk about a function type, and a function *as type* ^^' so yeah...
also, i'm not yet sure how this could be abused, so that's a concern too."
1379,1556531766.1523,Nana,are there any plans to add memoization to Elm?
1380,1556533360.1524,Huong,Not that I know of. Do you have a *specific* use-case where you feel like you would benefit from this? Seeing a concrete case with code would help (and would allow people to suggest workaround that apply to your case :slightly_smiling_face: )
1380,1556533724.1526,Nana,"well, I have quite a lot of places where I sort/filter a long list of items, before displaying it in the view, for example as options in select boxes
the issue with select boxes is that they also have an index which keeps track of which item the user is hovering over / has selected with up/down keys, so because of that `lazy` doesn't work; I could of course manually cache the result in the model, but it'd be cleaner to have a memoization function I think"
1380,1556533850.1538,Huong,"If the input to the function changes, memoizing wouldn’t help either, would it? Or, no more than `lazy` would, I’m thinking?; oh, wait, I can see how you’d do that"
1380,1556533908.1542,Nana,"so I'd memoize just the sorted/filtered list, but not the selection index"
1380,1556533915.1544,Huong,"so I’m assuming you have a long list of things, and a second variable that identifies a bunch of those things as being hovered or what not. Right, yeah.; gotcha. Yeah, the current recommended workaround, after identifying that this is in fact a performance problem, would be caching it on the model"
1380,1556534085.1557,Una,"Why is there no ternary operator in Elm? We have if..then..else, but elm-format insert a whole lot of space and newlines in it.

```
ternary : Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
ternary condition valueIfTrue valueIfFalse =
    if condition then
        valueIfTrue

    else
        valueIfFalse
```"
1380,1556534143.1559,Nana,and I think it'd be useful for a lot of similar things
1380,1556534717.1565,Liza,"i hade similar problem, but for cache some precalculated data, so i got structure like:
`{data:{..}, cache:{valid:Bool, cachedData:{...}}}`
so then i had some functions that needs that cache, and they return not just result, but also updated element,; but that not a case if You need that inside your view..; or just before exit update function, you can validate cache and if needed recalculate it.."
1380,1556534862.1571,Nana,I think validating the cache on every update could get expensive though? If it uses structural equality on big lists
1380,1556534892.1577,Liza,that is just `===` in js..
1380,1556534896.158,Nana,or maybe not? because it first checks reference equality right?
1380,1556534907.1583,Huong,"It first checks reference equality, yes"
1380,1556535080.1585,Liza,"for example - in my case that was SAT Shape - that had cached normals and projections, so if i change (by some function) position, with, or other component that impacts  cache - it was set to “invalid”, and there was (LOT of) functions that not care about that cache - so most of cases that invalid cache can stay for long time, and then if i needed (some one came too near to collide ) cache was recalculated, and that stay like that again for long time..; and validation of cache was just boolean stored in cache it self..; so in your example - it would be just, set to false when change filter, and before exit update (if that list will be shown)  check - do that prop (`cache.valid`) isn’t True"
1380,1556535311.1592,Nana,"this is one of the things I like in Vue, most calculations are done in ""computed properties"", which are memoized, and you can have computed properties which depend on other computed properties, which means that things only get recalculated when they really need to"
1380,1556535314.1594,Liza,"so - as result you not need to checks whole list, just manual invalidation each time when you make “cache braking”  changes"
1380,1556535389.1596,Huong,"You could either have that `valid` flag, or write a wrapped around `update` which would look something like ```cacheHandler : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
cacheHandler msg model =
  let
    original = model.source
    (updatedModel, cmds) = update msg model
  in
  if updatedModel.source == original then
    -- not changed
    (updatedModel, cmds)
  else
    ( { updatedModel | cache = calculate updatedModel.source }, cmds )
```; Since that check has a bypass for referential equality, things that don’t touch the `source` won’t trigger revalidation very very fast. If the reference did change, you still only revalidate the cache if structural equality _also_ says things have actually changed"
1380,1556535501.16,Nana,"<@Huong> ah that's pretty neat, saving the original value in a closure. I was thinking I would have to store a duplicate in the model"

1382,1556543066.1689,Maxwell,I was wondering if `Elm.Foo.init({ element })` was also considered when they decided it should be `Elm.Foo.init({ node })` instead and why was that?
1382,1556543084.1694,Danika,presumably because they're called DOM nodes

1382,1556544403.1748,Huong,"It’s not my call, but I’d stick to `node` - there is less ambiguity. JS having somewhat ambiguous function names shouldn’t influence Elm’s API :shrug:"

1385,1556549292.1767,Huong,"(I like using records like that when I know that it doesn’t really make sense to partially apply with only some functions first, and some other functions later)"
1384,1556549451.1769,Nana,"<@Huong> well, it does work :sweat_smile:
the way you use it is like:
```
Browser.element {
  update = watchModel update watchers

```
`update` is your regular update function
and `watchers` is a function which looks like:
```
watchers watch =
  watch .stuff computeStuff
  &gt;&gt; watch .things computeThings
```
and ""compute""-functions look like:
```
computeStuff model stuff = {model | computedStuff = ...}

1385,1556549791.1785,Syble,"there is no ambiguity, an element is a node like a square is a rectangle : <https://www.w3.org/TR/domcore/#introduction-to-the-dom>

An element is a node.
An attibute is a node.
A chunck of text is a node.; and no inconsistency by the way :slightly_smiling_face:"
1385,1556549879.1789,Nana,"Do'h, you're right"
1385,1556550037.1791,Huong,"I think I see 2 issues - one is the order of operations:
- you need to gather all the values to watch _before_ the update, and then invalidate them _after_ the update. Currently, I don’t think that’s happening.
- when passing that `watch` function, it’ll get specialized to the first args it is passed. You need a rank-2 type for this (or use let-polymorphism but that means you can’t externalize `watchers`, so that seems pointless); Hmmm, I don’t entirely agree. Attributes aren’t DOM nodes. A chunk of text may indeed be a DOM node (and you can actually pass a textnode, Elm will just replace it the same way it would replace a node representing a `div` element).

The thing is this: a document consists of a tree of nodes representing elements, text and comments. Elm needs a node in that tree to bind to.; you can have 10 nodes representing a `div` element, and Elm needs one of those nodes, not one of those elements.; (granted, the DOM spec explicitly refers to Element nodes as simply “elements”, though I suspect that is because, within the context of the spec, this brevity makes sense and is disambiguated by them explicitly making that concession)"
1384,1556550732.1808,Isaias,Is it feasible to expect a browser to hold a variable of maybe 20^(7) elements?; I highly doubt it; What if they are really cheap elements like ints?

1385,1556550898.1838,Huong,"<https://ellie-app.com/5pTMhhdHgWNa1> example of passing a comment node; ahhh, yeah, you’re doing that right indeed :thumbsup:; the polymorphism you need doesn’t exist in Elm"
1385,1556550986.1852,Dede,"That’s 1.2 gigaelements.  If they’re 32-bit ints, densely packed, that’s about 5 gig of data.   That’s not a reasonable assumption to make about a browser, triply so for a mobile browser."

1385,1556551293.1859,Dede,"Yeah, that’s basically assuming you’ve linked your browser against LAPACK :slightly_smiling_face:"

1385,1556551548.1866,Huong,"To expand on my ambiguity comment: `&lt;a&gt;` is clearly markup for an element, whether it appears in a document or not. An element only becomes a node when it appears in a document. Since the DOM spec is concerned with the document object model, it’s simply not concerned about what you call stuff when it’s not in a document. When it refers to an element, in the context of the spec, that is always an element appearing in a document, and hence, a node."

1385,1556553795.1886,Huong,"with some minor changes, you could go for something closer to this:
```watchers : Model -&gt; Model -&gt; Model

```; For tests, construct a mock Navigator with closures that just print what's being attempted or whatever.; For the real code, construct a Navigator out of closures over the real Key.; Another approach, if you don't need to mock navigation events, is to store `Maybe Key` instead of `Key` on the model, and write wrapper nav functions that strip the Maybe off to do the work.; Another approach:
```type alias Model a = {a | 
  (all the non-key fields)
}
```

Use that type everywhere that isn't trying to do Nav operations, and then you can test with `Model {}` and do production with `Model {key: Key} `"
1389,1556562923.1985,Hoyt,"Yeah, was hoping there was a more straightforward way than all this, but looks like we’re going to have to head towards some form of dependency injection. I was hoping to test a function that calls `pushUrl`, but I’m thinking will need to rearrange things.

For the first, you have to manage the `Maybe` in your code and your tests. In the case of `ModelWithKey` your `update` function will have a bunch of empty cases unless you feel comfortable with `_ -&gt;`. In both cases, you are isolating the untestable parts of your code to make them as small as possible, but they’re still there."

1399,1556634529.2219,Virgie,"the `Foo` type alias is more a constraint than a concrete type. It means ""type with at least this field"", but that is not enough to actually create a value."
1399,1556634548.2227,Huong,"`fooBar : Bar -&gt; Foo {}` would work, but then that’s just `Bar` really; If you construct a record and you know all the fields, the type signature has to reflect this fact. Since you can’t construct a record with an unknown set of fields, you can’t return an extensible record with an unbound type variable denoting the other fields"
1399,1556635112.2324,Audria,"I have a tricky riddle for you all to play around and exercise the brains. Given a `button` function accepting a type of a button (like Submit, Cancel or Normal, affecting the visual appearance) and size of a button (like Small, Medium or Large, also affecting the visual appearance), we want to disallow certain combinations of type and size (we don’t have Large Normal button in our design system). It is kind of easy in runtime (return empty `text` node if the disallowed combination comes in), but… How could we achieve this on type level (or via any other means to catch it during compilation)?

The only idea I came up with is to explicitly list all possible combinations as a union type; or introduce one of the types parametrised with a specific another (eg. `type ButtonType = Submit SubmitSize | ...`) which is almost the same in its core.

Can it be done in a more elegant way in Elm? In any other language you know?"
1400,1556635377.2345,Alicia,"if it doesn’t have to be a compiler error you could force it down to valid states, something like

        { button | size = Medium }

1410,1556716158.2732,Virgie,"well, as they say, here be dragons

go to `~/.elm` and find the package that you want to mess with, eg `/home/folkertdev/.elm/0.19.0/package/elm/file/1.0.5`. You can change the source there. Nothing will happen yet though because everything is cached.

You then have to remove all 3 `.dat` files in that directory. Now go to your project, remove elm-stuff and recompile it; but again, you should not be doing this (maybe except for testing fixes to packages in your app). it is not supported, it is hacky, it is not distributable; in the sense that your elm.json is now inaccurate as to what version is actually used in your app"
1410,1556716293.2738,Dede,"You’ve looked at the canonical examples?; I have an idiosyncratic approach here, which some people have found at least interesting. <https://github.com/jhbrown94/experimental-elm-spa-skeleton>"
1410,1556716422.2742,Carmon,I get it - but thank you.  I am hoping the master is released before my app is complete. OTOH it's not like I've never been bitten in the a** by a dragon
1410,1556716714.2744,Liane,"Not the most helpful answer, but if you've followed and understand the canonical examples, my recommendation is that there isn't a good rule of thumb, you have to start from first principles. And that means sitting down and thinking out your app, because the spaghetti is frequently inherent in how complicated your app is, not coming from the language; I do have 2 easy rules that I have found almost always make things better: 1) Find types and build modules around them. Do not worry about module size, if the functionality is logically related. 2) Keep the app as flat as possible. A big app can happily be one package. Things seem to me to want to be packaged as logical units, not to keep code length down, in Elm.; Elm helps avoid writing impossible states, but state transitions are all that your Elm code _is_, so to get that right you have to get your helper functions right. Try to make sure that certain transitions only happen in one function, and you can't accidentally do it differently in two places"
1410,1556717134.275,Tarsha,"Main issue I run into is the impossibility to 'remove' type information, so you can't neatly group things based on abstract 'shape'. If I'm not mistake <@Dede> is essentially doing this by expressing every triplet in terms of parent model and msg. I guess this can work but it seems 'nasty' to use an input type that is only partially supported. In contrast, my API router in Haskell looks like a table of endpoint names, verbs and handlers.

Maybe I'm just asking for too much for a language the aim of which is to remain simple."
1410,1556717249.2752,Liane,are you saying you would like to abstract out page triplets?
1410,1556717356.2754,Tarsha,"Speaking at a high-abstraction level: I'm not interested in 3 values, I'm interested in 1 page, and I want to reason about that page as being a *page* not a `Page model msg`.; At least not with bound `model` and `msg` types."
1410,1556717567.2758,Dede,"The `Descriptors` in my skeleton try to give you most of that.  They hide the page-specific model stuff entirely, and most of the page-specific msg stuff.  That said, it sounds like you are pining for more traditional object-orientedness with inheritance, and that’s really not where Elm’s philosophy lies."
1410,1556717694.276,Tarsha,"More like typeclasses, but that's considered too complex for Elm, and I can see where that notion is coming from.; I guess the two approaches try to fulfill the same abstract desire.; Essentially I want to do sort-of what you did, but with type-restrictions being internal."

1414,1556732890.2824,Efren,i did notice it was noticeably less buggy and slow than similar apps; so i was wondering
1414,1556732986.2828,Leoma,Are you familiar with CSS?
1414,1556732992.283,Efren,yea
1414,1556733012.2832,Mirian,The bullet points on the package site sum it up quite well from my perspective. I know barely any CSS so a library that allows me to not write is heaven-sent.
1414,1556733021.2834,Leoma,So you’d probably agree there are countless ways to get strange unintended layouts in CSS.
1414,1556733035.2836,Efren,certainly; every time im frustrated about css (frequently) i think there should be a better alternative
1414,1556733051.284,Leoma,"Many times, with valid CSS, you’d get an output that probably no one would ever want"
1414,1556733051.2842,Efren,is this my savior; also is this the docs <https://elm-ui.netlify.com/documentation/getting-started/setup>
1414,1556733076.2846,Mirian,oh it's another library I think
1414,1556733082.2848,Leoma,So elm-ui says: “let’s try to have this layout business make more sense”.
1414,1556733117.285,Mirian,all docs for `mdgriffith/elm-ui` are here:  <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/>

1414,1556734111.286,Leoma,"Yes. That’s a good video. Starting with elm-ui is deceptively simple. Read the basic Element module API at <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/1.0.0/Element>. That gives you a good overview of all the basic stuff. Need more on Input? It’s in Element.Input. Need more on Borders? In Element.Border.
Finally, `Element#layout` turns your elm-ui layout into html.; Really, you can just get started building stuff."
1415,1556735190.2871,Latonya,would it be possible to add a class or ID to the debugger div that is inserted on local elm projects?

1419,1556746766.315,Huong,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/zwilias/elm-bytes-parser/latest/Bytes-Parser#randomAccess> is my preferred method for this kind of thing
1419,1556746770.3152,Virgie,"you can first decode the header and then sort. In general I've found a two-phase decoding process easier in this sort of case: once to slice the buffer into smaller buffers (one for each table), then individual decoders for the tables"
1419,1556746787.3154,Huong,"if you know where a “lump” starts, this is pretty straightforward"
1419,1556746812.3164,Hoa,"Ah, you sort the “directory” part by the offset, right?"
1419,1556746820.3166,Virgie,exactly
1419,1556746830.317,Hoa,"Oh, that’s clever; Lemme see!"
1419,1556746889.3181,Virgie,then something like `List.map2 (\small large -&gt; large - small) offsets (List.drop 1 offsets ++ [Bytes.width myBytes]) ` to figure out the sizes of each table
1419,1556746897.3182,Hoa,Indeed I have offset and length for each piece of information; Looks we have a winner :slightly_smiling_face:  Thank you
1419,1556747023.3195,Huong,"Yeah, as long as you have a way of calculating where to start reading (either absolutely by setting `relativeTo = startOfInput` or relatively by using the `position` parser earlier on to get a position you want to use as the relative offset later on), you can use this to run whatever parser you have at that position, and then resume wherever you were before"
1419,1556747120.3207,Hoa,OK. I think I’m able to go on. Thank you!
1419,1556747645.3209,Yahaira,"Thanks! I guess this is the downside of ""zero config"" :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1420,1556755933.3241,Sofia,"Hey folks -- I've built a drag and drop library, primarily for use inside my company. I'd like to be able to generate documentation from the code for others to read. I can't quite figure out how to do that:
- I'd be fine publishing it, but it needs ports for certain touch event compatibility.
- If I make a separate `package` elm.json, there's no way to install it to my projects.
- `elm make --docs` doesn't do anything for `application` types: <https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/1835>

Is there a canonical way to do this?"
1420,1556757425.3256,Earnest,"<@Sofia> You're not going to be able to publish anything with ports. You could have an npm package for people to use that they could wire up to ports they define in their applications.

I don't think you can publish `application` types either, but I've never tried. You'd need to pull that code into a separate `library` elm package."
1421,1556759886.3258,Latonya,"instead of the contains selector i just went with the full style: `[style=""position: fixed; bottom: 0px; right: 6px; border-radius: 4px; background-color: rgb(61, 61, 61); color: white; font-family: monospace; pointer-events: auto; z-index: 2147483647;""]`. i'm sure it's not the most performant css, but it's not a huge deal for this case"

```; so im continually updating the model with random values, is that a no-no?; this is for an honors project studying betting btw"
1422,1556782297.3364,Huong,"That still looks like a similar issue to me - there’s nothing special about random, and it is, in fact, a rather straightforward module (except for all the math) :smile: My guess would still be an edge-case that’s resulting in some sort of loop within `makeDecision` - is it tail recursive, by any chance?"
1422,1556782362.3372,Isaias,"no, but its called by a function thats randomly recursive, so it could be that my check for stopping isnt quite right,; right now im trying to monitor the number of recursions but my browser crashed xD"
1422,1556782592.3384,Huong,"ahh, yeah, could be that `playGame` is randomly (tail) recursive, indeed!"
1422,1556782657.3395,Isaias,"ok, so it doesnt recurse any more than 6 times; just empirically determined; so its not that; so the structure is i have a generator emit a msg, which in update emits a generator of that same message; its constantly updating itself with newly generated random values; can I not have update msg itself all the time?"
1422,1556782834.3425,Huong,"oh, so it never actually _stops_ or pauses?"
1422,1556782873.3438,Isaias,"nope, its just supposed to continually compute data, and ideally the renderer will give me analytics about its computational process; if the dom doesn't stall"
1422,1556782890.3444,Huong,"YEah, it’s not getting a chance to render :sweat_smile:"
1422,1556782907.3452,Isaias,should I intersperse it wiht time breaks?
1422,1556782972.3465,Huong,"`Random` acts as a synchronous effect, basically - it gets the request to generate something random, that’s sent to `update`, and `update` request more random data. There are likely calls happening to schedule a render, but since that function just keeps going, it probably doesn’t get a chance to do so; So yeah, interspersing some `Process.sleep`’s every now and then would definitely help!"
1422,1556783032.3478,Isaias,oh its synchronous; how many fps should i give it
1422,1556783089.3492,Huong,"Alternatively, you could decide to manage the `seed` yourself, and use that `Cmd`-less API of `Random` by using `step`, and subscribe to `animationFrame` to sync everything up and do up to 60 “loops”/second. So whenever a `tick` comes in, generate your data, update the seed in the model, and return your `( updatedModel, Cmd.none )`"
1422,1556783130.3495,Isaias,"and i could use a time seed; I dunno, I want really random randomness for the sake of accuracy in the study"
1422,1556783157.3506,Huong,"Yeah, or give yourself some initial random seed through `init` if you’re using `element` or `application`"
1422,1556783178.3516,Isaias,like if it doesn't behave really randomly than how applicable would my results be?
1422,1556783182.3518,Huong,"`Random.generate` uses `step`, too, and uses the current timestamp as the initial seed; so you’re not losing anything"
1422,1556783193.3522,Isaias,"hm...; If i switch to a cmd less api i have to rewrite a lot of code too, its like all monads"
1422,1556783246.3533,Huong,"as far as randomness of `Random` goes, it uses an implementation of PCG which is prettty good; I don’t think you’ll need to change that much"
1422,1556783269.3544,Isaias,Isn;t there like a basic monad of no effect?
1422,1556783273.3547,Huong,"only the `Random.generate` call, really - the generators can stay; so rather than ```( model, Random.generate yourGenerator )``` you’d have ```let (generatedVal, seed) = Random.step yourGenerator model.seed in ( { model | val  = generatedVal, seed = seed }, Cmd.none )```"
1422,1556783383.3564,Isaias,oh right i can still use generators; yeah that implementation is already abstracted in my code; can I have an animation subscription with both the time AND the delta? just curious
1422,1556783850.3585,Huong,"I don’t believe so, although getting the delta is easy if you have the time and store the time of the previous go :smile:"
1422,1556783917.3592,Isaias,&lt;beginner question&gt;when should I use Browser.element vs Browser.document&lt;/beginner question&gt;; yeah that seems like the basic way to do that; Cant you subscribe to both and have them happen at essentially the same time?
1422,1556784018.3614,Huong,"`document` means you take over the entire DOM: it will bind to the `body` tag and replace all of its contents, and allows you to control the page title"
1422,1556784080.3628,Isaias,oh right; Does elm distinguish between animation frame and eg physics update frames; I think the latter is essentially animation frame delta
1422,1556784168.3653,Huong,"So the levels of control (and complexity) are something like this:
- `main : Html msg` -&gt; allows rendering a static piece of HTML in a single element
- `Browser.sandbox` -&gt; a basic program without effects (no cmds, no subs)
- `Browser.element` -&gt; basic program with effects
- `Browser.document` -&gt; basic program with effects, represents the entire document including title
- `Browser.application` -&gt; the above, + navigation and url control"
1422,1556784223.366,Isaias,Why dont they just have like a `Browser.static` instead of changing what main can return
1422,1556784323.3669,Huong,gradual learning - no need to know about the `Browser` package for the simplest of programs: at that point you’re just writing HTML and some functions to generate that HTML perhaps
1422,1556784352.3677,Isaias,Can elm run headlessly?
1422,1556784355.3678,Huong,"so you could start someone of with some exploration in the REPL, then graduate to `main : Html msg` to see something in the browser, then add `Browser` and `sandbox`, etc; yeah, there is `Platform.program` which is like `element` but without `view`"
1422,1556784397.3689,Isaias,"I hugely appreciate how much attention elm gives to the developer experience, pacing, and the like"
1423,1556784530.3708,Isaias,"in this case though, I'm not sure how much of a learning curve it would be to have a beginner see `main = Browser.static (text ""hello world"")` versus `main = text ""hello world""`"
1422,1556784556.3715,Isaias,they already see boilerplate like in the module declaration
1422,1556784622.3728,Huong,"Sure, it’s a small extra step! It’s also a historical thing, too - `program` used to live in `Html`, so `Html.static` would be weird. As a side-advantage, imagine a future world where server-side rendering in Elm becomes a thing - not using the `Browser` package there also makes sense!"
1422,1556784746.3745,Isaias,"yeah it definitely hints at the opportunity to move across other domains, that is why im sort of nitpicking this since i see that it may better organize what main can return to put all frontend output in `Browser`; but for now, not really a problem"
1422,1556784908.3769,Huong,"Yeah, we’ll see how things pan out :slightly_smiling_face: I think the option of using `elm/html` without involving `Browser` etc is pretty sweet, though, I’ve found it a pretty nice path when dealing with students. It wouldn’t be much harder to add `elm/browser` in the mix, but it is another tiny extra distraction :shrug:"
1422,1556785080.3772,Isaias,you deal with elm students; what exactly is your role in the elm community? youre on a lot
1422,1556785190.3791,Huong,"Oh, you know, I just hang out on Slack really :sweat_smile:"
1422,1556785194.3793,Timika,He is the all-knowing kind oracle :slightly_smiling_face:
1422,1556785213.3797,Isaias,<@Timika> that's actually not that far off from my experience; <@Huong> have you made modules
1422,1556785231.3804,Tarsha,"Yes every update to a model is a state transition. Reading it back I worded this question rather poorly. Primarily I'm looking for a nice clean way to represent pages without relying on knowledge of the overarching structure, which obscures intent with what I consider to be spaghetti code (or perhaps I should say spaghetti dependencies, but the effect on a human's ability to reason about code is similar)"
1422,1556785238.3807,Timika,"Oh yeah, I did mean this exactly as I wrote it. :heart:"
1422,1556785323.3808,Huong,"Sure! <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> has a few, and there’s a few 0.18 ones I didn’t upgrade because they weren’t really used by anyone. Also a bunch of tooling (`elm-xref`, `elm-coverage`, `elm-json`) which aren’t exactly modules, but, you know, it’s code either way :smile:"
1422,1556785420.3811,Isaias,tooling--do you mean in the compiler?; oh are you zwilias there <@Huong>
1422,1556785513.3816,Huong,"no, external things you can download and use. `elm-xref` finds unused code, `elm-coverage` measures code-coverage for `elm-test` (which I’m also involved with), `elm-json` is the newest in the family and allows dealing with `elm.json` files (i.e. installing/upgrading/removing (test)dependencies, etc)"
1422,1556785531.3818,Syble,alm-coverage rocks (just missing the --watch flag though :p)

1422,1556785651.3825,Isaias,<@Huong> why are you so interested in elm? what makes it worthy of your time?; question: why is there still unzip if there isnt zip? and: why isnt there zip anymore?
1422,1556785729.3833,Huong,"I like the community and the language, so I got a job which involves Elm. Packages and tools are mostly to scratch my own itches, or because I notice a recurring problem on Slack and get tired of dealing with it :smile:"
1422,1556785752.3839,Isaias,whats your job
1422,1556785841.3857,Huong,"`unzip` is a little harder to write and for whatever reason (in my experience at least), used slightly more often than `zip`. Writing `List.map2 Tuple.pair` is pretty simple! That said, I don’t know if `unzip` should really be in core :shrug:"
1422,1556785852.386,Isaias,is it because its hard to guarantee length?
1422,1556785869.3861,Huong,"I’m a developer, first and foremost"
1422,1556785896.3866,Isaias,"Isnt `(,)` still a function?; a frontend dev"
1422,1556785979.3872,Huong,"Nope, the tuple constructors were removed in 0.19; Eh, backend, too - whatever is required"
1422,1556786011.3877,Isaias,Will tuples be removed?; where do you work? what do you think of it?
1422,1556786112.388,Huong,"I’m actually at work so I don’t really have bandwidth for general small talk, sorry! We can chat about this later, if you’d like :slightly_smiling_face:"
1422,1556786126.3884,Isaias,sure
1422,1556786158.3891,Huong,"It’s not really a plan right now, but who knows what the future holds :smile:"
1422,1556786169.3893,Isaias,id be fine with it; If they were replaced with `Pair` or maybe some slightly mroe convenient syntax
1422,1556786261.3905,Syble,what's your issue with tuple syntax ?
1422,1556786318.3913,Isaias,"`Pair a b` is easier to manage than `(a, b)` on a textual level; also easier to read because you dont have to parse that the parentheses aren't a subexpression"
1422,1556786406.3932,Nana,"<@Isaias> actually I found this Tuple replacement package :smile:
<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/bburdette/toop/latest/>"
1424,1556786448.3934,Nana,kind of sounds like what you want
1422,1556786503.3937,Isaias,perhaps; thanks for the tip
1422,1556786549.3947,Syble,"If you reduces tuples to the usage of pairs, it might be sound, but I like to envision the third dimension :monkey_face:; I honestly don't know if Pair 1 2 is clearer than (1, 2)"
1422,1556786581.3955,Isaias,"tuples dont support the fourth dimension atm; but you can do `(x, (y, z))`; And also just `Triplet x y z`; Idk either; Question: does elm have tail call elim?"
1422,1556786723.3972,Timika,Yes :slightly_smiling_face:
1422,1556786756.3974,Isaias,":tada:; None; so I have a problem; So I want to run a bunch of state-dependent computations, but I dont want the dom to constantly rerender because it causes it to crash; actually... i think i have an idea.. ill repport back how it works; ok it didnt work; yeah so essenntially i want a continuously updating model but a `view` function thats only effectively called on animation frame; i dont really know enough about when elm decides to call view to optimize that; i dont want to slow my computations to animation frame if i dont have to"
1425,1556787698.4034,Jin,`view` is most of the times called with the next animation frame.
1422,1556787729.4044,Isaias,hm.. then maybe its not crashing because of too many dom updates
1425,1556787742.4048,Jin,A sync render is e.g. done when you handle text inputs.
1425,1556787769.4052,Timika,Maybe you can batch your calculations in one function call? So the model just changes once.
1425,1556787806.4059,Jin,Long running calculations will block your view.
1422,1556787857.4068,Isaias,so like i have my model do a random calulation and then emit the next dependent calculation; so in theory it can essentially reduce to a monad op however i know that in the end the state will still require changing continuously; so batching more calculations just means more is asked to be done of the elm runtime at once
1422,1556788012.4088,Jin,You could do some continuation style as explained here <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/asynchronous-parsing/3412/3>
1422,1556788100.4097,Carter,I wonder why adoption of elm isnt bigger. Not that i no any figures but it seems the industry is mainly into typescript and React?; (from my POV there should be elm world domination) =D
1422,1556788372.4115,Isaias,dunno <@Carter> but i think the world as a whole does move toward improvement but is strongly biased with familiarity; Its kind of like live rendering an infinitely long file that you continuously parse
1422,1556788542.413,Syble,"from my point of view, it's mainly WP with jQuery, so imagine how Elm, a FP, would look like to those :smile:"
1422,1556789199.4136,Isaias,is jquery still used for new projects?; is it dying
1422,1556789522.4156,Liza,"if it is done by some backend dev.. or if dev have not enough exp..
as main function was `$` (sizle) that now is replaced with `document.querySelector`"
1422,1556789525.4157,Syble,honestly I don't know
1422,1556790401.4168,Isaias,is it possible to write a `mapN` with lists or does the type system not allow it
1422,1556790665.4169,Syble,"Well, the problem is the target function declaration I guess. AFAIK, there is no variadic functions in Elm"
1422,1556790747.4171,Isaias,so a type variable cant stand for a function type?
1426,1556791133.4173,Isaias,cant recursive union types work like variadic functions
1422,1556791190.4175,Lashawna,"It is possible to write a variadic `map`, but, since it has to be type-safe, all lists should have the same type"
1422,1556791202.4177,Huong,How would you imagine a signature for such a function would look? :thinking_face:
1422,1556791241.4179,Lashawna,"```

1422,1556791267.4183,Huong,"Yeah, I meant <@Isaias> :smile:; <@Lashawna> that would be `List.map (List.map f)` right? Just so I have the right mental model in mind"
1422,1556792121.4187,Nana,seems like that `mapN` function would pretty much just be `List.foldl`
1422,1556792181.4189,Huong,"oh, even just `List.map` :smile:; ```
(a      -&gt; b) -&gt; List a        -&gt; List b
(List a -&gt; b) -&gt; List (List a) -&gt; List b```; anyway, long story short: if I hear `mapN` in this context, I imagine a function which takes a list of lists, and a function that has the same amount or parameters with corresponding types as the list of lists. It’s definitely not trivial to express that in Elm types, and I have a hunch it might not be possible at all. If I have some free time later, I might give it a go, but whatever I come up with, will be painful to use in practice, I can promise that much :smile:
(vaguely related: types for a binary tree structure that enforce the result is a balanced binary tree that maps to an AVL tree - <https://gist.github.com/zwilias/ccd72ee7925b27e8c41176ebe7d33564> - because types are magic)"
1427,1556793050.4195,Isaias,its very cool
1422,1556793139.4197,Isaias,"i imagine its related because it has to do with recursive types, I was thinking you might be able to use something like a `Succ` system to determine how many more times a function can be called; I was thinking about counting with types the other day, and looked for it, but couldn't remember where i saw it before. This is it!"
1422,1556793206.4201,Huong,peano numbers

1422,1556793316.4209,Huong,"Yeah, he did a `vector` module with them at some point, I think"
1422,1556793376.4211,Isaias,"""loop/structural invariants that can be enforced at compile time"" might make a fun senior thesis; can i chain cmds? why is there no Cmd.andThen?"
1422,1556793753.4227,Huong,"A command is not guaranteed to even lead to a result (ports and navigation are good examples), so chaining them with `andThen` doesn’t really make sense; That’s what tasks are for :slightly_smiling_face:"
1422,1556793915.4237,Isaias,right... i think i need to better articulate what i want

1428,1556794714.4282,Earlean,<@Vilma> you include some kind of id value in the produced msg to identify which item was clicked

1428,1556797500.44,Isaias,"my best guess is that the idea is that hierarchially sound applications should be written top-down, and ""components"" are an excuse to write bottom-up, so unless you take state from the top and move it down, you aren't writing in best practice"
1429,1556797523.4401,Bud,"If you are using the SPA example, then I think for me its based around what I want to display to a user at a particular time… i.e. what page are they actually on?"
1428,1556797569.4403,Bud,Which is about as “top down” as you can get I believe.
1428,1556797648.4406,Isaias,"sure, except `Article.Feed` is more like a reusable view than a page"
1428,1556797683.4408,Bud,Totally. Seems like a thing you would want in multiple pages
1428,1556797713.441,Nana,"you only need ""components"" when you want something that manages private state"
1428,1556797748.4412,Isaias,"<@Nana> i mean, yeah. but how do you know when local state is better is my question"
1428,1556797929.4415,Nana,"I think what Feldman recommends is to avoid it when you can, only use it when you have to; for example custom select boxes, date pickers, and pages in an SPA"
1428,1556797987.4419,Isaias,"why are those ""have to"" cases, arguable you can keep all that state in one place"
1428,1556798129.4421,Nana,"well, you could have your pages state be global, if you don't want it to reset when switching pages; but select boxes and date pickers need a lot of logic for updating their state, so you want to have reusable update functions for them"
1428,1556798921.4425,Isaias,evan would argue otherwise in the life of a file.; tbh select boxes are particularly something i would write as a controlled component in react
1428,1556799414.4431,Nana,you mean stateless?
1428,1556799555.4433,Isaias,"yup thats what they call those in react land; Tasks are essentially cmds but with the option of failing, right?; How can `Time.now` fail?"
1428,1556799663.4447,Nana,"my select boxes for example have this private state:
```
type alias Model =
    { open : Bool - wether the dropdown is open
    , filter : String -- filter results by a string
    , index : Int -- for navigating with arrow keys

1428,1556799847.4456,Kenya,`Time.now` is guaranteed not to fail because it is polymorphic in its error type

1428,1556799933.4466,Danika,"Tasks are side effects, commands aren’t "

1428,1556800184.4491,Nana,"isn't it more the opposite? :stuck_out_tongue:
Tasks don't produce any effects by themselves, you always have to turn them into Commands and pass them to the runtime"
1428,1556800187.4493,Kenya,<@Isaias> Oops! Cmds /do/ return something. So I don't know why `Time.now` is a `Task` rather than a `Cmd`.; Oops. Cmds do return something. So I think your initial statement is right without additions.

1428,1556800382.4518,Isaias,well it makes sense bc random cant fail
1428,1556800497.4521,Nana,"Tasks can be chained, Commands can't, that's the real difference I think"
1428,1556800537.4523,Earlean,"Task and be sequenced with other Tasks using `Task.andThen`, that's why `Time.now` gives you a Task"

```
lib
↳ Dandy

  |_ elm.json (package with exposed_modules set for documented modules and same dependencies as the app)
  |_ src

You can then run `edp` on `./lib` to get the application documentation. And use `elm make lib/src/Main.elm` from app to build the application.

You have however to add the dependencies twice (a simple script could automate this).

In the future, elm-doc-preview will most likely scan `source_directories` parents to use found elm.json in order to also support forked packages:

1437,1556831631.4887,Sofia,That's really interesting! This might be worth pursuing then
1437,1556831635.4889,Janiece,"You could also go this route even if you don't actually publish the package...setting up a proper package structure should allow you to use `elm-doc-preview`, and then you can just add the package source directory to your application's source directories"

Recently had an issue with localstorage giving me old data because of a race condition where I'd set the localstorage from elm and then immediately set it again - apparently the second time was hitting the port first for some reason, meaning the older request was overriding the newer one; Is it possible to run `update` on first launch of an `application`? If not, how am I supposed to parse the initial URL? The docs talk about parsing URL query parameters being used for, e.g., search terms. I get that `onUrlChange` would have fired if someone appended `?search=monkey` to the URL, and then my `update` gets to handle it. But what if that's the URL that the page was opened with? How do I run my monkey-searching logic from my update function?; `init` only lets you affect the model (and by extension, the view), But I guess I could have it spit out a model that's already been run through the update function? Like so:
```
init : flags -&gt; Url.Url -&gt; Nav.Key -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags url key =

1439,1556841263.4966,Earnest,Just pull out the UrlChanged branch into a function and call it from both update &amp; init.
1440,1556842234.4976,Isaias,"<@Janiece> do you know why `Time.now` is a task, not a cmd, if it cannot fail?; <@Huong>  then why is random a cmd if it can guarantee a result?; <@Earlean> cant you sequence cmds if the callback takes a `Maybe Msg`?"
1440,1556842995.4985,Kris,The fact that it cannot fail has nothing to do with that 
1440,1556843082.4991,Isaias,:thinking_face: i was mislead. What is the reason <@Kris>
1441,1556843156.4997,Kris,"Well, tasks are strictly more powerful than commands "
1440,1556843190.0006,Kris,So you should ask why some command is not a task in any case (like Random) 
1440,1556843461.0009,Isaias,"Ive been asking both, yeah; Why even differentiate the two?"
1440,1556843782.0018,Kris,"Yeah I asked the same some months ago ; I believe the answer is that tasks are “guaranteed” to produce results, eventually ; While commands are not "
1440,1556843903.0037,Isaias,"Oh.. i think i understand now, i just needed to hear it enough times :upside_down_face:; Or but i still dont know why random isnt a tadk"
1442,1556845852.0086,Leoma,"Well, a Cmd is opaque. At that point we can’t really do anything with it except hand it to the runtime. Tasks are different, we have andThen and Sequence. So maybe Task is chosen when it’s possible you’d use it with andThen or Sequence. So I’d suggest there is a limitation on random being a Cmd. "
1443,1556848953.009,Earlean,"You can sequence Cmds by going through `update`. Eg. A Cmd produces a msg, the runtime calls `update` with that msg and `update` returns the next Cmd to be run"
1444,1556866954.0096,Dayle,alright! I’m having trouble getting my elm application to run. I’ve tried the basic example with the counter in the elm guide in it runs fine but when I try to run my SPA it just stops on `Elm.Main.init`. It works fine in the Cordova browser but not on iOS or Android. Maybe you have some hard earned insight into what could crash the app in iOS and Android?
1440,1556868336.0107,Nana,"I think there's no need for a Random Task, because `Random.Generator` basically does the same job as a `Task` :thinking_face:"
1440,1556868612.0121,Earlean,"Not really, `Random.Generator` can only be sequenced with other generators, so you can't generate a random value and sequence that with sending that random value on a http request; You can create a Task that does calls to `Random.step`, but you need to manage the seed yourself so the result of the sequence of tasks needs to include the new seed so you can storage it for the next time you want to generate a random value.; A Task version of `Random.generate` would have the runtime manage the random seed value so you wouldn't have to"
1440,1556869048.0148,Huong,"I think this is the main reason that it isn’t built in - this would require kernel code in `elm/random`, which is currently pure Elm (+ an effect manager, which can only do commands, not tasks)"
1445,1556878194.0157,Chin,any idea why Elm doesn't see a change event on a dropdown when I use selenium?
1445,1556879222.0158,Walton,What worked for me was to use `selectByVisibleText`; Did you try this one <@Chin>?
1445,1556879272.0163,Chin,What I mean is that the dropdown selection does change. But Elm doesn't receive the event.; Haven't tried that.
1445,1556879348.0167,Walton,"I had the same issue…the dropdown changed, but the event in Elm didn’t fire. This method worked correctly."
1445,1556879395.0169,Chin,who has that method?
1445,1556879434.0172,Walton,it looks like it’s WebdriverIO specific; I don’t know if I can help then; but I found it here: <https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html>; <@Chin> what selenium version are you using?
1445,1556880444.018,Chin,I'm actually using Capybara
1446,1556891666.0194,Allyn,Hello. elm-analyse identifies unused imports. Is there a tool to remove them automatically?
1446,1556892159.0206,Alicia,"elm-analyse has a fix mode that can do it (part of the web UI for it), but it can only fix them one at a time.  I’m working on adding that to <https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server> so that you can get quickfix actions in the editor"
1446,1556894369.0234,Allyn,"I was looking for a CLI based solution. I generate some code using openAPI generator, which write some code with useless imports. So I’d like to clean it automatically every time we generate some code."
1447,1556897111.0236,Millie,"That would be the implementation of this issue: <https://github.com/stil4m/elm-analyse/issues/116>; A workaround for now could be to ignore the directory in `elm-analyse` because it's generated code, which is not maintained by you.; `excludePaths` <https://stil4m.github.io/elm-analyse/#/configuration>"
1447,1556897250.0242,Allyn,"I had not seen it was possible to configure it!; Thank you very much <@Millie>, it will be very useful"
1448,1556912617.0302,Leoma,"So, I think Elm’s `view` function needs to have the signature `view : Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)`

Reason is as follows:
1. if/when you break your app into ’components/pages/whatever you call them` then each component will have a Model. This model represents the history of messages that the component  triggered. It does NOT represent the history of the calls to `view`, which is called anytime there is new data to render.
2. Suppose the view want’s to focus an element. This is not a result of the component’s model change (where we could trigger a Cmd during update). This is a result of new data being passed to view, which the component’s update isn’t necessarily aware of.
3. The fix is `view : Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)` where we can trigger a call to focus.
4. It is now actually possible to do the above with a small hack AND it fixes otherwise not easily fixed issues."
1448,1556914082.0336,Alicia,"I think that might not work with how elm uses requestAnimationFrame right now, if view is only called every 16ms there may be times in that 16ms window when the `view: Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)` would have produced messages; it’s not very Elm-y but we’ve been using custom elements where we set properties on the HTML from the Elm side, then then JS side looks at those attributes and makes the magic happen, stuff like `TextInput.view { autofocus = True, placeholder = ""Testing"" }` which gets rendered out as our custom input field like `node ""custom-text-input"" [ Attribute.autofocus True, Attribute.placeholder ""Testing"" ] []`"
1448,1556914337.0394,Jake,<@Leoma> how would view know which element to focus without access to the previous model?
1448,1556914338.0395,Alicia,"and then in the custom element it is like
```
class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt;
      const elem = this.querySelector[""input[autofocus]""];
      if (elem) elem.focus();
    }
  }
}
```"
1448,1556914453.0423,Chae,What/when are you trying to focus an element? Does `Html.Attributes.autoFocus True` not work for you?
1448,1556914462.0427,Alicia,autofocus only works on initial page load
1448,1556914466.043,Leoma,Autofocus only works on the first render
1448,1556914506.0456,Alicia,"I left out some there, we also have a `setTimeout(() =&gt; &lt;focus code&gt;, 0)` inside the `requestAnimationFrame` because we’ve seen times when it wasn’t actually rendered when the animation frame fired"
1448,1556914551.0483,Jake,"You'd still need a declarative autofocus (""focus this node when it's first rendered""), not an effect (""focus this node after (each) render"")"
1448,1556914552.0484,Loralee,"I'm developing with elm-live and at each save of my file, elm-live take about 4 plain seconds to serve the new compiled js (after it has been compiled!). My elm file is quite small : 180-lines... Did you already encounter this issue?; here is the log of elm-live"
1448,1556914608.0507,Alicia,"<@Jake> the code runs in the `connectedCallback` in the custom element, as long as it is a leaf node elm will not re-render it; so it only runs once"
1448,1556914616.0511,Leoma,"Threading this; So here’s the problem. I want to add a field and focus it. That field is added by calling to an async DB function in javascript, and when that slot propagates into the Elm model, render it.
This is async, so I can’t , in an update do `({model | fields = newFields}, focus newField)` because the field isn’t ready."
1448,1556914644.052,Chae,"Could you do something like `Html.Keyed.input (changeKeyHereIfShouldFocus)  ...`? That should re-render the input and trigger the autofocus, no?"
1448,1556914666.0523,Leoma,"I’ve started a thread; Thread here RE `view : Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)`"
1448,1556914740.0528,Jake,"I was writing about the ""send Cmd from view"" idea, I see your approach as the right one."
1448,1556914769.053,Chae,How do you know when it’s ready?
1448,1556914769.0532,Leoma,"Further, the code waiting to focus the element is a component with it’s own `view/update/Model` tuple. Of course, the data to be rendered is passed into `view`. So the component’s update isn’t aware that the field is ready to be focused."
1448,1556914816.0534,Alicia,"we could but I don’t like it as much as using custom elements for it; I would use a custom element, the `connectedCallback` fires when the element is in the DOM and you can focus it"
1448,1556914867.0538,Leoma,"So, when the component’s view is called, I have:
`view : ExternalData -&gt; InternalModel -&gt; Html Msg`

The external data represents knowledge of the new data slot to render. The internal model has knowledge that we asked for the slot, and would like to focus it.

The place the knowledge naturally comes together is in the view function."
1448,1556914869.054,Alicia,granted if you don’t already have the polyfills and everything in for them it is a pain
1448,1556914904.0542,Leoma,"So my point #4, “It is now actually possible to do the above with a small hack AND it fixes otherwise not easily fixed issues.” hinted at the fact that is is how I fix it.; And it works exactly as expected."
1448,1556914919.0546,Jake,"Oh, that feels like you have merged view and update"
1448,1556914939.0549,Leoma,No
1448,1556914990.0551,Chae,In your view are you “calculating” the readiness of the input by something like `if xValue &amp;&amp; yValue then ready else notReady`?
1448,1556914997.0553,Leoma,"Consider a component’s model/update. A component’s update is called when the component triggers a message. So a component’s model is a history of that component’s events. It is NOT a history of that component’s views.; So the component’s model can know that the component requested a new field.
A component’s view is called when the top level data changes.; So, if you are waiting for the first time that a particular relationship between a component’s history AND the data model exist, you will get that during a call to view.; If you want to trigger some work when that happens, you will need to trigger it from view."
1448,1556915128.0561,Jake,"I feel that for a stateful component ""new data is available for rendering"" should be a Msg too.; Same as it is at the top-level where you get a Msg from a port"
1448,1556915176.0565,Leoma,"Ok, there’s a problem with that, and the problem is that it is not enforcable with the type system"
1448,1556915184.0567,Chae,<@Leoma> do you have a simplified example of how you know when your input is ready?
1448,1556915227.0569,Leoma,"no i don’t; I’m trying to explain more broadly; Please give me a moment without more quesitons; A component’s view can generate messages, (and a (component might have subscriptions). These will have a type of Component.Msg. So if another view/update uses them, it HAS to wrap them `type Msg = ... | MyComponentMsg Component.Msg`; So, at this level, in update, when we get a `MyComponentMsg Component.Msg` it’s very clear how it must be handled. `Component.update` should be the only function with a type signature that can make use of these messages.; So it is very easy and clear to enforce “a component’s model is the result of the history of events on that component”; There is no way to easily enforce “I’m a component that needs it’s update called when particular data changes occur, and I really hope whoever is using me remembers to to that diligently”; Consider that such a change could occur in any part of the parent’s update function, or any functions it calls. It is very challenging to enforce this cleanly.; It also breaks the single source of truth as a component now has a copy of data that exists in it’s callee’s model.; For those reasons, I’m convinced that there will be times you want to look at data coming in from the parent model, AND data available in the component’s model, and trigger an event. And the cleanest place to do this is during view.; Does that all make sense?"
1448,1556915762.0591,Chae,It does make sense
1448,1556915779.0593,Leoma,Yay! Thanks for listening.
1449,1556915928.0595,Chae,Am I understanding correctly that the view for this component is relying on data from it’s own model as well as a “parent” model?
1448,1556916095.0598,Leoma,"Again, a component’s model is a function of it’s history. What a component renders is a function of it’s history AND ALSO what the callee passes into view.

Consider an info panel that can be toggled open and shut. The component’s model might have `{isOpen : Bool}`, and the view might be `view : String -&gt; Model -&gt; Html Msg`; So the implementation of view says “if my current model is open, render the toggle button and String passed in, else just render the toggle button”"
1448,1556916190.0602,Chae,"Ok! That makes a ton of sense to me as I’ve encountered that exact scenario many times (in React actually); I’ve found that with something like that, it’s much easier to store things like `isOpen` and such in the parent/global state. The only time I use a “component” model is when the values in the local model are truly local."
1448,1556916329.0606,Leoma,"Ok, so suppose we have a requirement that if a view is toggled open, and that rendered view contains a profanity, we need to log a message via http call."
1449,1556916447.0612,Chae,Hmm
1448,1556916460.0614,Leoma,"Again. A component’s model is generated by a history of the events the component has generated. Other stuff is not a part of that model. There’s nothing else to it.
The first time we can simultaneously look at “history of the events the component has generated” and “other stuff” is in view.; And again, the type system makes it easy to enforce that  Msg originating from a component are sent back to it’s update. Anything else is hopes/prayers and fighting the type system."
1448,1556916806.0625,Chae,"My gut is telling me that `isOpen` should be part of the “parent” model. But I’m going to think about it for a bit.

Just over a year ago we had a situation where we needed to focus a field that could be inside a collapsed accordion view, and if so open that section of the form. We ended up moving the open state of the view to the global model. But I’ll keep thinking about this one and try to get back to you in a reasonable time"
1448,1556917015.0627,Leoma,"Right, so the toggle was an example.; But if you agree that there is a possibility that some data should be in the component’s model, then I think the rest of my ideas hold.; In any case, I’m not suggesting it’s impossible to avoid the need for `view : Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)`, I’m suggesting that at times, avoiding that need will be unnatural and problematic.; Now, a custom element can use `dispatchEvent` in `connectedCallback` to trigger any event. Via this hack, one can trigger a Cmd Msg when something is rendered. Effectively giving you  `view : Model -&gt; (Html Msg, Cmd Msg)`; I am using that now to make the rest of my code nicer."
1448,1556917588.0637,Loralee,"never mind, I've restarted elm-live and... it is working well."

1465,1557150889.108,Leoma,"It’s not because `Time.Posix` shouldn’t be comparable. It’s because, more strongly, there are general rules for what is comparable. Basic types like numbers, strings, (not Bools), tuples, lists.

Because Time.Posix is not one of those, it isn’t comparable.

Because we have `posixToMillis` and `millisToPosix`, we can compare on the `Int` data."

If Elm doesn't recycle that node, we might not get the `touchmove` events at all.

This plugin is made by Google and I believe is the standard screen reader on Chromebooks. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. For example, if you go to the elm-packages page then none of the links work if Chromevox is installed and running. Has anyone else had this issue and/or know what the cause is? Viewing the console shows that 100s of exceptions are being thrown each second."
1488,1557333311.2209,Virgie,does that extension modify the dom? Elm (and any framework with a virtual dom) does not like others touching their dom nodes. This is a common problem with various browser plugins
1488,1557334262.2242,Albina,"Thanks <@Virgie>. It does. However, some Elm apps I've tried on the Made with Elm website do not seem to be affected by it so I wondered if anyone knew what particular feature of Elm causes the problem so it could be avoided. I want to make my Elm apps accessible and usable on Chromebooks so I'm going to have to figure out what the problem is."
1488,1557334372.2255,Virgie,"it might be the program type. If elm just takes over an element on a page, then the extension might just not modify it, but if elm is responsible for the whole body then any modification will be a problem; a common pattern in extensions is that they add a child to &lt;body&gt;, so if you make sure that is allowed you're probably good"

1505,1557428523.2739,Kymberly,"Hey all, I had an interesting problem to solve, thought I'd discuss solutions here since it was a fun one to wrap my hands around.  Reauthorizing and retrying HTTP requests after a `401` error.  But here's what made it interesting: lots and lots of requests in flight, but the `refresh_token` can only be used once.  So any request can fail, maybe lots of them, but they need to enter a ""waiting queue"" if a 401 hits and a refresh_token request is already in flight.; I was already using `Task`s to control the flow of Http requests (many of the requests resulted in a chain of requests; fetching a ""folder"" also sent requests for each ""file"" in the folder, and recursive requests for each subfolder); what I ended up with was:
```
type RetryTask a
    = Retry (Task.Task Http.Error (RetryTask a))
    | Success a


reAuth : Task.Task Http.Error a -&gt; Task.Task Http.Error (RetryTask a)
```; what I _really_ wanted was a way to have the Task queuing independent of the `update` function, but I'm pretty sure that's impossible.  Once a request fails (and sends `Retry task`) that needs to be turned into a message, and the `update` code passes these tasks into a request queue, depending on the `model.authStatus` (where `Reauthing` means ""queue the task, wait for `ReauthResult`).; anyway, if someone else has tackled this another way, I'd love to hear about it."
1506,1557433208.2813,Alicia,"rather than storing the tasks, how about a data structure that describes the tasks, then you can put those in a queue, something like
```
type ApiCall =
    FetchFolder String
    | FetchFile String

type ErrorWithRetry = ErrorWithRetry Http.Error ApiCall

The `Retry`'s are handled by the top-most app.; Yes, this actually comes up too, in a way.  To queue the tasks, we need to store both the task _and_ the `Msg` that receives the successful result.

I explored what would happen if we thought of components as relational data and came up with a nice way to create reusable components. A great example when this would be useful is if you have an advanced form component or a sortable table that you would like to reuse on different pages. With the usual approach you would need to wire up the update/command/init/model for each page but with this approach you will only need to do it once. Another case this would be useful is if you have a dynamic form, in which case this approach makes it trivial to add hundreds of forms.

1541,1557737527.4207,Raylene,"But it can be useful if, for example, you use this to serialize the model; It's a decoder that returns a default value instead of erring out.
Main difference between that and using Result.withDefault is that it can perform a partial parse

so if you pass {x:5} to the Point decoder you will get (5,0) instead of (0,0); Of course if you pass ""hello"" you will get (0,0)"
1541,1557737710.4213,Jae,So if you don't provide a permissive decoder then you'll get Err result like what happens in Json.Decode?

Once the header hits the top of the page, it will become fixed and not scroll off the page. The rows in the table will continue to scroll. How would you go about implementing that? My understanding is that I'll need to keep track of the position of the header to figure out when it hits the top of the page.

1549,1557771906.4366,Simon,"From a member of our team:

1. in order to structurally separate table headers from the content rows, you need to use `table-layout: fixed` mode (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/table-layout>)
2. your model needs to be in charge of turning `position: sticky` on and off for the table header section
3. you need to be firing a task to determine the relationship between the scroll position and the start of the table

table-layout
The table-layout CSS property sets the algorithm used to lay out table cells, rows, and columns."
1549,1557772086.4369,Marcus,"Thanks <@Rosaria>. That's awesome information. It sounds like there is a bit of JS/Elm tomfoolery in there to adjust the classes based on scroll position, unless I'm misreading it."

onKeyDown =
    Decode.field ""key"" Decode.string
        |&gt; Decode.map (\key -&gt; ( KeyDown key, True ))

How can I prevent default only if `key` is, e.g., `""x""`?; ```
onKeyDown =
    Decode.field ""key"" Decode.string
        |&gt; Decode.map (\key -&gt; ( KeyDown key, key == ""x"" ))

Also, what is `KeyDown key`?"
1559,1557828651.4646,Danika,KeyDown is a `Msg`: <https://github.com/andys8/vim-emulation/blob/91da6521dc9d59858485f9209c79329630ba3470/src/Model.elm#L47>

1559,1557829068.466,Maxwell,"Is that Elm 0.19?; I can't find the docs for `Decode.field`. And I don't know if that's 0.18 or 0.19.; Basically, I can't understand the whole expression.; By the way, I was also looking at the `Html.events` docs searching for an `onKeyDown` to see how a regular keydown event works, but it seems like there is none?"

`preventDefaultOn` needs the name of the event, and a decoder that decodes the event object into `(msg, Bool)`, where the Bool is whether or not to prevent default; re: no default onKeyDown

&gt; Note: It looks like the spec is moving away from event.keyCode and towards event.key. Once this is supported in more browsers, we may add helpers here for onKeyUp, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, etc."

1559,1557829655.4782,Maxwell,"So, that would be the message I process in my `update` function, correct?"
1559,1557829693.4796,Nana,"<@Maxwell> that means that they don't give any value; ie. `onInput` gives you a string, but onClick is just an event without extra info"
1559,1557829904.4856,Danika,"In this case, the onClick is a function that takes any message and gives back a `Attribute msg` whenever that element is clicked.

Its intentionally generic because how can anyone know about *your* `Msg` type.

you might do:

```
type Msg
  = ButtonClicked
   | ...

— somewhere in view
button [ onClick ButtonClicked ] [ text “click me!” ]

As simon says (heh), this particular implementation decodes no extra info off the click event "

1566,1557864309.0134,Jae,"I gave your API a try then. I have a data structure that represents the wires and chips on a circuit board (for a game I'm making). Currently I've written encoders and decoders for converting this to bytes and back.  It involves a lot of record types and writing those using your API was quite easy to do.  I didn't feel like I was in danger of introducing subtle encoding bugs (I have not tested my code though). The same cannot be said of elm/bytes where I could lose 15 minutes hunting down two bytes that got flipped between encoding and decoding.

For ADT's, I only attempted one thing, I have a datastructure that looks like this
```type CircuitPosition a b
    = WirePosition WireId Float a
    | ChipPosition ChipId (Point Int) b```
and I had a lot of trouble converting that into a codec, even when using your example as a guide. This is what I ended up with (it's incomplete)
```circuitPosition : Meta a -&gt; Meta b -&gt; Meta (CircuitPosition a b)
circuitPosition wireDataMeta chipDataMeta =
    Meta.adt

`elm make Main.elm --output=/dist/index.js` for example; (And then include dist/index.js in your html file)"
1568,1557903044.0339,Majorie,OK. I have done that before. But I am wondering what is the idea having such (working in Ellie) line in index.html : var app = Elm.Main.init({ node: document.querySelector('main') })
1568,1557903253.0341,Dexter,because you might want to add Javascript that uses the ports you define (they will be available on `app.ports`)
1568,1557903459.0343,Majorie,I think var     app = Elm.Main.init({ node: document.querySelector('main') }) should some how pick up the functionality from Main.elm; I should figure out how it should be compiled ..

1569,1557908117.0377,Loralee,"Hi folks !

I would like to clearly identify when NOT using Elm. Could you give some concrete use cases where Elm was not suited (because of performance, ecosystem, ... whatever)? (please answer in the thread)"
1568,1557908208.0378,Majorie,"Well, this is working: &lt;script src=""main.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=""elm""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    //var app = Elm.Main.init({ node: document.querySelector('src/main') })
    var app = Elm.Main.init({
            node: document.getElementById('elm')
        });
    // you can use ports and stuff here
  &lt;/script&gt;; So at the moment I leave ""document.querySelector .."""
1568,1557909758.0384,Lynne,"`querySelector` is looking for nodes inside document so using it like this would not work, of course.; If you have further questions or don’t understand how anything works feel free to ask"

1570,1557911403.039,Timika,"I would (professionally) not use it in cases where I don’t build an UI for the web. I’ve seen experiments to use Elm in backend systems or even postgres triggers (<@Jin> :P). Those are nice and interesting experiments, and I really want to use Elm as much as I can, but as those things are not the current design focus of Elm, I won’t use Elm there.

It’s just too risky that workarounds for backend specific problems might be gone in  a new Elm version (and that is a good thing in the grand scheme!) or other aspects of the language change that might prove to be roadblocks. As soon as Elm has non web-UI stuff as a design goal, I will quickly jump on-board though. :slightly_smiling_face:

1572,1557915344.0499,Guadalupe,"Hello. I risk repeating an earlier question by <@Daryl> about pre-loading, but I think it moves the discussion on (as well as asking a question to him in particular). There seem to be a number of strategies that people have used for preloading images: 1) A port to a javascript preloader, e.g. 'Programming Elm' and <https://github.com/Libbum/Odyssey> - ; 2) Use a Web Component - I can't find an example of this approach but there is this excellent video and a catalogue of web components:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyFe9Pw6TVE> - ; 3) Load html into the model - this approach is used by @rogeriochaves in his interesting proof of concept of a port of react-suspense: <https://github.com/rogeriochaves/elm-suspense> - You would need to use html/css rather than elm-ui (which I much prefer) since elm-ui doesn't currently seem to recognise onLoad events. Loading html in the model seems utterly weird, but is it? I've no idea- any opinions?;  4)  'manually' fetching the image over http which gives the advantage of being able to use it with the  RemoteData package - I thought about it, but I have actually no idea what this looks like (I tend to tie myself up in conceptual knots at times) - <@Daryl> do you have a simple example you could point me to, please. Can anyone comment on the relative merits of these approaches and be kind enough to direct us to any examples that I have missed, please."

1571,1557916964.0527,Lynne,"I see. You need to set `checked` attribute of the radio button to match the value in model; For example, if you have `selectedOption` field which you update when user clicks on a button, you should add `checked (value == model.selectedOption)` where `value` is something identifying this particular button; <https://ellie-app.com/5xWFVYnRQGxa1>"
1571,1557917282.0533,Ashton,"A buddy of mine, who wrote a fair amount of Elm before deciding he didnt like it, said something to the effect of “We just re-write the front end every 8 months anyway, so investing a lot in stability and maintainability of our front end isnt worth it”.; I thought that was an interesting perspective, even if I dont ultimately agree with it."
1571,1557918603.0537,Loralee,"It seems weird they re write ALL their codebase indeed.... it is maybe rewritten but incrementaly , no?"

But, I’d like to be able to have a field in a record (the commented out `thing` record) where the field name is something that I pass in.

The context is that I’m working on a form, where I want to get the value, (float) and also the label (string) from 2 different records, using the same accessor"

1577,1557932609.0602,Garnett,"I’ve effectively re-saved it, hopefully <https://ellie-app.com/5y2FrWYzyrLa1> works"
1577,1557932831.0605,Hoyt,"If I’m building a pretty mundane set of CRUD screens, just for updating some data, I don’t use Elm. I just write the html in whatever server-side templating that comes with the web framework and then just rely on raw html form submits, etc.; Or if there is just basic interactivity that I can use built-in html5 stuff for.; A record’s fields can’t be accessed by, for example, an arbitrary string.
You can, however, pass in the accessor, something like
`extract .foo record`
But, at that point, probably just better to do `.foo record`"
1577,1557933165.0613,Dede,"The re-save worked.  But yeah, what <@Hoyt> said.  If the value in the two records has the same name, the autogenerated `.name` accessor will get the value out of either regardless of the value's type."
1577,1557933303.0616,Hoyt,"But, you can’t build something that would, say, allow you to pull out a field based on the name as a string
`extract ""label"" record`
If you really want this, then you would need to switch to a different data structure, such as a `List (String, a)` or `Dict`"
1577,1557933803.0618,Garnett,"I’m not trying to create an accessor based on a string. I’m trying to create a record that has a field with an accessor that can return either a string or a float (as crazy as that sounds).

E.g.

```
        acc =
            .a

        foo =
            { a = """" }

        bar =
            { a = 0.0 }

        _ =
            acc foo

        _ =
            acc bar
```

In this snippet, `acc` can return both a string and a float, depending on the record that it’s called on.

I want to have _another_ record which has a field to store that accessor, but the name of the field is arbitrary.

E.g.

```
type alias Obj a =
    { accessor : a -&gt; Float
    }
```

I can then call `Obj .foo` or `Obj .bar`, but in this case, it can only return a float, as opposed to either a string or a float.

It’s a little confusing to explain haha; So I’d love to be able to see what `acc` in the first snippet’s type definition looks like"
1577,1557933890.0622,Dede,"I think it's something like this:
```
acc: {x | a: t} -&gt; t

1577,1557933960.0626,Garnett,I’ll give that a go!
1577,1557934268.0628,Dede,"If I have it wrong, the compiler error message will probably give you the precisely correct answer :slightly_smiling_face:"
1577,1557934986.0631,Garnett,"In this case `t` is either `Float` or `String`, and in the record definition I need to have it bound to one of them, and can’t do both :confused:

E.g.

```
    { attributes :
          { label : String
          , max : Maybe Float
          , min : Maybe Float
          , placeholder : String
          , step : Float

    , update : Maybe Float -&gt; a -&gt; a
    , value : { x | a : t } -&gt; Maybe t
    }

But `numberField` needs the 1st argument to be:

    { attributes : Form.Base.NumberField.Attributes Float
    , parser : Maybe Float -&gt; Result String Float
    , update : Maybe Float -&gt; a -&gt; a
    , value : a -&gt; Maybe Float
    }
```

`t` should be `Float` which makes the compiler unhappy"
1577,1557935154.0633,Dede,"Ah.  If you want these two distinct records to have the same ""shapes"" so you can put them in a list together, you'll need to make a tagged union to hold a float or a string.  If you can manage the records for different fields separately, you can push `t` further up the food chain.; Roughly something like this:
```
type alias Record attr t =
    { attributes : attr
    , parser : Maybe Float -&gt; Result String Float
    , update : Maybe Float -&gt; attr -&gt; attr

1582,1557950703.0818,Dayle,"I have a question about maintaining state in a list view while opening subviews. By list view I mean a table or similar with a number of elements which are clickable. Upon clicking a n element a subview with additional information is displayed.
*The issue*
In the list view I have a number of filters which one can enter to narrow down the results in the list view. Once an item is clicked, a new url is pushed displaying a new view with some additional information. When clicking the browser back button I see the list view again but now all filter settings are back to default settings which is not desirable.
*A solution?*
I have experimented with not pushing a new url, instead routing messages through the list view which will keep the state of the list view. However the url is not updated to reflect that we are viewing a subview and there is no url history recorded so clicking the back button will jump to the page displayed before the list view.
*Question*
Are there any idiomatic ways of solving this type of problems in SPAs in general and Elm in particular? Maybe I’m going about things the wrong way or my thinking of how the list view / subview relation should work is backwards."
1582,1557951306.0828,Alicia,<@Dayle> would it make sense to include the filters as query parameters in the URL? it could have the added benefit of allowing people to share URLs with filters pre-applied
1582,1557951362.0834,Rico,Perhaps `Browser.Navigation.back` might help?
1582,1557951384.0838,Alicia,"another way could be having a “backstack” of previous states, and when someone hits back you pop off the current state to return to the previous one; Android apps do something like that"
1582,1557951413.0844,Rico,"I wonder if it might preserve state in a useful way (as opposed to the browser back button, which I guess doesn’t.)"
1582,1557951457.0852,Dayle,"yes, adding the filters to the url is a good idea, will have to look into the “backstack”, thanks <@Alicia>!"
1582,1557951487.0857,Alicia,"yeah you’d have to have a `List Model` or similar that you store, kinda like people do for undo/redo"

Nav.replaceUrl ?; would you say that storing the contents of the list itself in session storage is valid design decision?; quite new to javascript SPA programming so trying to pick up some good habits :slightly_smiling_face:"
1582,1557952112.0894,Alicia,"`replaceUrl` will change the URL but not trigger a page load (you do get the updated URL to parse), internally it uses `history.replaceState({}, '', url)`"
1582,1557952132.0895,Dayle,"well, I would have to hijack the back button of the browser to prevent it from performing a “proper” back action"
1582,1557952291.0921,Alicia,"I think keeping it in session storage is a valid design, we do something similar using `localStorage` as a cache for stuff, we’ve landed on a pattern of having it read-only on the Elm side, so if you want to modify something in the cache you modify it and send it out to `localStorage` which then stores it and sends it back in; with `sessionStorage` only living for the life of that tab it might be easier to keep it in memory in Elm though; like as a `Dict String (List something)` where the key is the ID of the list"
1582,1557952657.0982,Dayle,"yes, as long as I keep the state of the list view when viewing the subview that would work ok which is the solution I was experimenting with but then I end up with the browser navigation issue. I could open the subview as a modal on top of the list view and replace the url with the path of the current subview. The only issue then (as I can think of) is that to the user it would make sense to tap the back button to get back to the list view but since there is no history recorded the browser would end up on the page previous to the list view. So question then is, can I hijack the back button to simply close the “modal subview” instead of jumping back in history?"
1582,1557953670.1016,Alicia,"you could use `pushUrl` to add a new entry to the browser history, I would probably structure it like
1. Getting to the subview requires clicking a link (normal `a` tag), I would include the current set of filters in the URL I generate
2. Since it was a link it will get routed through `pushUrl` and added to the history
3. Hitting back then would take you out of the subview and to the previous view, you could parse what filters should be applied for it from the URL (maybe something like `/list/12345?startDate=2019-01-01&amp;endDate=2019-02-01&amp;anotherVal=something`)"

Anyone experienced anything similar? What's the solution? Removing the JS-created DOM elements before changing the page doesn't seem to make any difference.

1599,1558113968.1461,Willodean,<@Augustus> by depth I mean what is the cache size?
1599,1558114020.1469,Augustus,"It isn't stored in a cache like you are thinking of; Check out that code in virtual DOM, there is is comparing the old and new arguments to see if they are referentially equal, if they are all equal it will lazy render"
1599,1558114881.1489,Willodean,so the depth is 1; as in it stores the last value only; The old arguements is the cache
1599,1558115187.1513,Augustus,Sorry I thought you were talking depth like keeping a cache for the arguments to view functions for child nodes of lazy nodes
1599,1558117596.1516,Willodean,"right, which it does <@Augustus>"
1601,1558118081.152,Kira,"Thanks! I have been playing a bit with lazy and keyed and they didn't seem to make any difference. After poking a bit, it seems that it's specifically how the _menu_ plugin manipulates the DOM to insert the menu. I'll try web components first, and if not I'll probably modify the menu plugin to expect that the needed HTML elements are already there (created with Elm), instead of creating them itself."
1602,1558118471.1533,Alicia,"nah it only does for the top level, if any of the arguments has changed it re-renders it all; forgot I switched accounts, antew is me too, this is my work account :slightly_smiling_face:; like say you have a function

This is the update function of the submodule ""Person"":
```
update : Database -&gt; Msg -&gt; State -&gt; ( State, Maybe OutMsg )
update db msg state =
```
My child modules return their updated state, and sometimes a special OutMsg.
This is one example of this type:
```
type OutMsg
    = OutCmd (Cmd Msg)
    | CreateLink Link
    | UpdateLink String Link
    | RemoveLink String
    | CreateKumu String
```
Here is a part of the parent module's update function dealing with this kind of child module:
```
        ( PersonPage page_state, PersonMsg page_msg ) -&gt;
            Page.Person.update state.db page_msg page_state
                |&gt; (\( new_state, out_msg ) -&gt;
                        ( { state | page = PersonPage new_state }
                        , case out_msg of
                            Just (Page.Person.OutCmd out_cmd) -&gt;
                                Cmd.map PersonMsg out_cmd

                            Just (Page.Person.CreateLink link) -&gt;
                                with_current_time &lt;| create_link link

                            Just (Page.Person.UpdateLink link_id link) -&gt;
                                with_current_time &lt;| update_link ( link_id, link )

                            Just (Page.Person.RemoveLink link_id) -&gt;
                                remove_link link_id

                            Just (Page.Person.CreateKumu person_id) -&gt;
                                Router.navigate key &lt;| Router.NewKumu ( Link.Person, person_id )

                            Nothing -&gt;
                                Cmd.none
                        )
                   )
```
If you want to fire an API call from your child module, you wrap it into an `OutCmd (Cmd Msg)`.  Your parent module will pass the result to your child module."
1614,1558216421.2242,Nathan,<@Malinda> That seems to makes sense. So your modules are still relatively tightly coupled to the overall application since you are restricted to a single global model but you can have a top level update whose primary job is to route to the relevant update functions to the appropriate module and provide the routing glue for the various inter-module communications. Is that the general idea?
1614,1558216481.2249,Malinda,"Yes, this is how things work in Elm.; You always have only one Model. One single source of truth.; But you can divide your app to relatively independent modules."
1613,1558218980.2295,Nathan,"So does your main Msg type look something like ```type Msg
    = ModuleOneMsg Module1.OutMsg
    | ModuleTwoMsg Module2.OutMsg```"
1614,1558222082.2315,Malinda,"No, something like this:
```
type Msg
    = Module1Msg Module1.Msg
    | Module2Msg Module2.Msg
```"
1613,1558224476.2331,Nathan,"Ah yeah, so Module.OutMsg is part of the return value of the modules own update functions and gives each module a mechanism to get the main update function to invoke commands on the modules behalf."
1614,1558225766.2333,Malinda,"Yes, exactly"
1615,1558255845.2338,Lynne,I have looked again into sources and it feels like it is just not implemented; In <https://github.com/elm/core/blob/master/src/Elm/Kernel/Scheduler.js> calling `spawn` leads to enqueuing an object with tag `__2_PROCESS` for which there is no separate branch in `_Scheduler_step`. So it feels like this “spawned” process is treated as failure.
1616,1558274667.2346,Shin,"Absolutely! And for those who would like to really understand what is going on behind the scenes with a traverse operation, I suggest this amazing article by Scott Wlaschin: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/elevated-world-4/#traverse>"
1616,1558274721.2351,Danika,scott is an absolute gem; he should be like an FP ambassador or something :joy:
1617,1558279257.2376,Vilma,how can I use `Bytes.width` to decide which decoder I should use? The `elm/bytes` package APIs don’t seem as flexible as `elm/json` :sadpanda:
1617,1558279493.2379,Virgie,can you give a bit more info on what you're trying to do?
1617,1558279567.2382,Vilma,"yes; let me try to simplify my question; <@Virgie> I’ve got two possible sequences of bytes:
```
Seq1 =&gt; N (1 byte) | A (4 byte) | B (4 byte) | C (4 byte)
Seq2 =&gt; N (2 byte) | A (4 byte) | B (4 byte) | C (4 byte)
```
So each sequence has 4 different parts (N then A then B then C). However, `N` can vary in width (for Seq1 its 1 byte, for Seq2 it’s 2 byte).

I believe I need to first find out the width of the sequence to then determine if I should use the decoder for Seq1 or for Seq2; there’s no `oneOf` like in `elm/json` :thinking_face:"
1617,1558279842.2426,Virgie,"oneOf would be inefficient, in binary protocols it is always possible to do this up-front to speed up decoding (which is part of the point of using a binary protocol); are you using `expectBytesResponse`?"
1617,1558279875.2433,Vilma,hum…. no? don’t know what that is
1617,1558279884.2435,Virgie,<https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/Http#expectBytesResponse>; with this one you actually get access to a `Bytes` value; instead of having to immediately give the `Decoder`
1617,1558279946.2447,Vilma,I see :thinking_face: but I was actually aiming at using my decoder for WebSockets instead of HTTP
1617,1558279980.2451,Virgie,then how do you get the data? what does it look like at the start
1617,1558280054.2463,Vilma,not sure yet :sweat_smile: just thought about writing this parser/decoder for a certain binary protocol which can be useful to me and started right away playing with `elm/bytes`
1617,1558280078.2467,Virgie,well in this case I think the length of the sequence needs to be an argument to the decoder
1617,1558280083.247,Vilma,yes; I thought the same
1617,1558280149.248,Virgie,"then given the current websocket situation, the input is probably `Array Int` which you can encode to `Bytes` and then decode with the decoder"
1617,1558280354.2482,Vilma,I see…; I guess I’ll try by just developing a very minimal example and I try to get it to work via WebSocket; and try to better understand where to go next
1618,1558284177.2495,Cyndi,`elm make` always returns this
1618,1558284450.2502,Lynne,I bet it should not be run with Microsoft JScript runtime
1617,1558285576.2511,Cyndi,<@Lynne> its working fine when im using powershell
1617,1558287147.2525,Raylene,"It's a problem with your ""executable"" estensions; Don't call the output elm.js; And remove the elm.js file; Or remove .js from the environment variable, let me look it up; `PATHEXT`"

1619,1558298973.256,Virgie,"many are, e.g. <https://github.com/elm/core/blob/master/src/Platform.elm#L83>; core is smaller now, but similar things happend in `elm/json` and `elm/bytes`"
1619,1558299236.2567,Desire,"well those are fine; im interested in things like `List`, which doesn't even have a ""mock"" implementation"

1620,1558303724.2597,Erlene,Is it is possible to stop Elm following a 302 automatically? I'm using the 2.0 elm/http library.

1622,1558324374.2738,Carrie,"I want to get the value in the option. Is there any good way in elm?; My initial idea was to pass the value through with onClick, but it didn't seem to work."
1622,1558324543.276,Lashawnda,"No, following redirects is baked into XMLHttpRequest. If you can add a ServiceWorker to your application you can intercept the request and modify its redirect behavior from there"
1623,1558327792.2766,Kris,You do it with the select tag
1622,1558328736.2768,Carrie,What I want is to get the value in the option that I click on each time. I tried the onClick method but it didn't work.
1623,1558329070.2773,Dexter,you want to place an `onInput` on your select element
1623,1558329091.2778,Kris,"Yeah, you do that with the select, set it's `onInput`; And set the options' `value`"
1623,1558330577.2791,Raylene,"This is a limitation in html, not much you can do about it"
1623,1558330749.2801,Earlean,I like how React wraps the terrible API of `select` elements to make it like other inputs
1624,1558330998.2823,Lynn,"I think I’m missing something with `Process`. I’m try to get to cancellable backoff strategies. Not there yet as the following did not work
```
        addBackoff url backoff =
            let
                task1 =
                    Process.sleep (2000 * backoff) |&gt; Task.andThen (\_ -&gt; Task.succeed &lt;| TryOpen url)

            , task1 |&gt; Task.perform (\_ -&gt; NoOp)
            )
```
I can see the `NoOp`, but the `TryOpen` never comes to the update function. What am I missing?"
1623,1558331210.2826,Earlean,you're ignoring the value that task1 produces; which is the `TryOpen url` value
1623,1558331364.2838,Lynn,"ok, that makes sense.; what I really want is to use is `spawn`, and to store the id in my model, so that I can cancel it"
1623,1558331417.2852,Earlean,"```
task1 |&gt; Task.perform (\result -&gt; case result of 
  Ok tryOpen -&gt; tryOpen
  Err _ -&gt; NoOp)

1623,1558331459.286,Lynn,"ok, so your code will be broadly equivalent to the commented out line i think; my experimentation is mis-guided I can see though"
1623,1558331536.2875,Earlean,`spawn` isn't useful yet if you need the result of the Task
1623,1558331583.2884,Lynn,ah
1623,1558331594.2886,Earlean,since once you pass the Task to spawn you get back a task that just gives you the `Id` but doesn't give you a way to get it's result.
1623,1558331608.2889,Lynn,"yes, that was what I experienced; Ok, so no way to cancel , other than to check when the `sleep` returns in some other way?"
1623,1558331668.2903,Earlean,what are you canceling?
1623,1558331690.291,Lynn,I want to sleep for sometime and then get a message back; but the need for that message may go away
1623,1558331716.2919,Earlean,In most cases it's much easier to not cancel and decide how you handle the msg you don't want in `update`
1623,1558331720.2921,Lynn,"I could check that when the message returns, or cancel the process all together"
1623,1558331744.2926,Earlean,eg. set a flag in your model 'ignore this when it comes back' and check that before using the msg
1623,1558331769.293,Lynn,yep - that’s what I have at present. was trying to optimize that; thanks a lot <@Earlean>
1625,1558340154.2942,Bebe,That seems like the answer I needed for <https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/cancelling-a-process-sleep-task-before-it-fulfills/3666>

1629,1558405837.3132,Starla,I have a pre-existing app that runs on a different machine. I'm planning on creating a web-app that will receive information from those apps and display it on a browser(real-time). is that doable with Elm alone or do I need some sort of a backend framework for that?
1629,1558406246.3136,Erlene,Can't answer that without knowing how these pre-existing apps make their state know.
1629,1558408593.314,Starla,<@Erlene> I was planning on using sockets so that states will be sent real-time
1629,1558410722.3146,Earlean,<@Starla> is your 'pre-existing app' a web app? can you connect to it via http?
1629,1558410777.3153,Starla,"<@Earlean> No, it's not. And since the servers are in a local network, I have the capability to connect them via sockets instead of http which based on a few search will allow me to like monitor it real time I guess."

1629,1558411074.3198,Earlean,"Yep, browsers support 'websockets' which are like sockets but they have some restrictions and need to be accepted initially by a webserver"
1629,1558411656.3203,Starla,So you're saying a socket to websocket? or websocket to websocket communication?
1629,1558411812.3213,Earlean,You'll need to set up a backend mechanism that can accept incoming websocket connections and proxy them to your sockets
1629,1558412019.3223,Starla,"Ah, so I'll just have to set up my pre-existing app to stream info through a socket. Create a backend mechanism to accept those info and redirect them through a websocket so Elm can display them"
1629,1558416567.3234,Erlene,"<@Starla> I don't think you even need websockets. If your rsync process simply regularly dumps output to a text file, and elm retrieves that text file and parses it to find the progress indicator, I think you have enough."

1. You can change header stuff dynamically using ports but I am afraid that will not be effective for ""sharing previews"" because these previews - for my understanding - rely on just reading the html (no JS execution)
2. Google analytics has special implementation for SPA, you can find details in their documentation (<https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications>). The simples is still using ports. Intercept the events that you want to track and send http requests to Google Analytics. We do this in a wrapper around our updated that take all messages and  filter them"
1632,1558421064.3266,Raeann,The post mentioned by <@Lilli> is about Google bot being able to execute JS and so to index SPA apps. For SEO purpose is better to maintain the head section of the page dynamically (through ports as mentioned at 1.)
1633,1558424757.3274,Allyn,Hello. Is there a way to emit multiple messages when the response to an http request is received?
1633,1558424884.328,Ruthann,you can `Cmd.batch [ … ]` multiple commands as a response
1633,1558424979.3293,Earlean,"<@Allyn> wanting to do that is generally considered a code smell, it indicate that you're using msgs in place of calling functions.; msgs should describe something that happened rather than what you want to happen in response to them"
1633,1558425609.3337,Ruthann,"a common scenario we have for doing this is when a page does a backend call, the page gets the response, has business logic to resolve the call but then needs to do 1 or more of: close itself, display a notification using a module higher up, tell the nav to do somenthing, change the route higher up.
as a child node, it must communicate the results upwards so we batch cmds to do this; another one we have ( although could be written differently ) is where we chain these function calls up quite deep without the model, so instead of calling a function and passing in the model, we just return a Cmd.batch and cause another effect."
1633,1558425890.3359,Allyn,That’s exactly our use case; I don’t see what could be the other effect...
1633,1558425968.3366,Ruthann,"The thing you have to realise here is that if you’re not passing these `msg` down into your page, and using globally defined types, then you’re coupling the page and all that responds to these msgs, to that global type; so when you batch cmds, it goes out of elm and comes back in as another side effect; Its not the best thing to do imo, but we haven’t found a better way. We couple things like Route to all pages; we actually don’t use Cmd but wrap it up in a `Job msg` unfortunately, i didn’t discuss this in my gitbook"

1648,1558526012.4196,Nana,btw why are you doing all this?; maybe there's a simpler solution? having all buttons as model/view/update sounds annoying
1649,1558528042.4201,Merlene,So I can check if the token has expired - we can't submit actions if the access token has expired
1649,1558528151.4219,Leonore,How does everyone handle authentication for websockets? We use tokens for authentication in our application but the Web browser API doesn't support custom headers for some reason. Even though it is in the spec of the websockets.
1649,1558528163.422,Nana,"you could just make the request anyway, and if the server rejects it, show an error or something; you could also set a `Process.sleep` with the expiration time when the user logs in, and then return them to the login screen when it expires"

1650,1558533426.4304,Carman,"I have a text input. Depending on what value it contains, it might get wrapped in a div and have a validation message as a sibling. If I'm typing in the input and that transition happens, the input loses focus.; My understanding is that this is because the vdom is creating new DOM nodes to build the wrapped input and the new input no longer in the focused state.; You can see it in action here - type capital character in the input and see that it loses focus (same if you delete the capital character) <https://ellie-app.com/5C73b9T5XwMa1>; I wondered if using `Html.Keyed` would allow me to tell the vdom to reuse the input node instead of creating a new one. However that doesn't seem to work if the input's parent changes <https://ellie-app.com/5C73yczMkdWa1>; Is there a way to change the input's parent without creating a new input node? Is the only solution to make the input have the same parent in all branches?"
1650,1558534303.4349,Earlean,<@Carman> you should be able to add Html.keyed on all the parents of that node until you get to the node you're replacing.

1650,1558536042.4371,Carman,Does that work if I'm introducing a new node in the ancestor chain? The input used to be a child of the form but is now a grandchild; I was hoping to avoid that due to the way our design system works :smile:; but it looks like that might be the only solution
1650,1558536343.4377,Earlean,"That's probably not going to work, you can manually refocus the input yourself, but you can also change the hierarchy to avoid this issue; Vdom diff-ing is a best guess at what you want in terms of node reuse, there are slots of structural changes that won't always do what you want them to.; ReactJS has similar issues"

1652,1558567829.4448,Earlean,Because types are written more than cons

1671,1558722251.046,Carl,I republished this morning under my personal account: <https://github.com/klazuka/elm-json-tree-view>

1672,1558722998.0482,Carman,What are you trying to do?
1671,1558723179.05,Rozanne,"animate an svg attribute/property.  i want the timestamp it was born (at a random position) so i can view the property as `propInitial * (1-t) + propFinal * t`, where t = 0 at its birth"
1673,1558724054.0519,Fidela,"is there a way to grant a javascript lib the ability to manage the content of an html element, and not have elm ""overwrite"" that when the state changes? the context is that I have a layout manager in elm, and I'm trying to run a canvas-based library in a layout item, but when I rearrange the layout all of the content of that item gets wiped out"
1672,1558724108.0524,Fidela,the js lib attaches to items with a specified id
1671,1558725582.0545,Lynne,You can try using `Html.Lazy` and always give same argument (referentially equal!) to the function returning your `canvas`; This way Elm will think your node does not need changing thus not wiping out its contents
1671,1558725858.0564,Fidela,"I will give that a try, though it sounds a little hacky (and maybe not reliable) :slightly_smiling_face: thanks"
1671,1558725924.0575,Lynne,"Well, generally you have to make sure that nodes with their own content (JS-managed) are leaf nodes in terms of VDOM"
1671,1558725924.0576,Fidela,I think my use case is a bit inverse from what elm might typically be used for; that will always be the case here I believe
1671,1558726248.0587,Raylene,@max You can use web components
1671,1558726298.0591,Fidela,"would the library I'm using need to be implemented using web components?; at a glance wrapping in a web component seems like the more correct solution; the lazy approach doesn't seem to be working, though I can't be sure why"
1671,1558729211.062,Lynne,Web component won’t help if you let your Elm app managing the `canvas` node; There is basically no difference
1671,1558729258.0634,Fidela,"elm doesn't necessarily have to manage the canvas, it could be a div that gets a canvas attached to it externally?"
1671,1558729272.0637,Lynne,Of course; Just make sure it is a leaf node
1671,1558729356.0657,Fidela,so I am trying to figure out exactly why lazy isn't working for me right now... I have the order of elements changing on a higher level so maybe that is preventing the container from staying lazy?
1671,1558729380.0661,Lynne,"Yep, in this case you may also need `Html.Keyed`; The container must know which of its nodes stay and which go"
1671,1558729419.067,Fidela,"alright, I will also give that a look"
1671,1558729446.0675,Lynne,"Also, the function you give to `lazyX` must be defined in outer scope"
1671,1558729468.0681,Fidela,"outer scope, like the ""file"" level?"
1671,1558729474.0686,Lynne,"Yep, the module level"
1671,1558729498.0691,Fidela,"ah let me try that, I was doing it from a `let ... in` from the view fn"
1671,1558729507.0695,Lynne,That won’t work
1671,1558729517.0701,Kris,"~That's not true, you can do `view _ = div [] [ lazy2 div ... ]`~"
1671,1558729536.0706,Lynne,So what’s not true?
1671,1558729557.0711,Kris,"That you need the lazy thing at the top level; Ah, nvm, I missed what you meant"
1671,1558729725.0726,Fidela,"moved them to the top level, but still no dice; generally what would cause a re-render of a node and its children? would this be in the vdom docs or something?"
1671,1558729800.0745,Lynne,"Elm calls `view` on each animation frame given there was a model update; And then vdom steps in, adding/removing/replacing the nodes or skipping them if `Html.Lazy` is used correctly; So basically, any model update would case a re-render of a node and its children unless vdom decides it is not worth it"
1671,1558730059.0775,Fidela,"so let's say I have something like this: ```
div
    div
    div with canvas
```; and that changes into ```
div
    div with canvas
    div
```; even if div with canvas is specified lazy, the higher-level change would still cause a re-render? or does the order matter in terms of which nodes it thinks are which, i.e. this is where keyed would come into play"
1671,1558730229.0802,Lynne,The higher-level change should not cause re-render of div with canvas if those div with canvas would be given the same id (referring to `Html.Keyed`); And built with `Html.Lazy`
1671,1558730474.0819,Fidela,"hm, I don't see a reason this isn't working but I also am doing some things wrt. manipulating elements that might be preventing this approach from working, maybe I am invoking lazy incorrectly too; regardless, I'll continue playing around with it, thank you <@Lynne>"
1671,1558730588.0836,Lynne,"If you keep facing problems, a way to help you would be to check an Ellie with the example"
1671,1558730628.0844,Fidela,yeah I can give that a shot
1671,1558730646.0853,Lynne,Do it
1671,1558730841.0857,Fidela,"can't do multiple files in ellie, hmm"
1671,1558730949.086,Kris,"No, you can’t "
1671,1558732348.087,Fidela,"well I got most of my code in there on one file, but Ellie's giving me a weird error `SyntaxError: '' literal not terminated before end of script`; that seems like something that would be caught by the compiler in the code so I think it might be an ellie problem"
1674,1558758580.0905,Eveline,"If you really want to name it, `modelAndCmd` should be a perfect name. But i genereally dont like to name the `(Model, Cmd Msg)`.; quick side note: your function can also be written as:

1680,1558809482.1251,Marquitta,"Hey everyone! Has anyone implemented detecting click outside an element with native Elm (without js ports)?
I have done it pure JS and Reasonml, and the idea was to subscribe to the global click and check whether `event.target` contains the element using `Node.contains`.
I have managed to use `Browser.Events.onMouseDown` in subscriptions, but couldn't get `target` out of it, and I didn't find anything that would resemble `Node.contains` inside `Html` package.
Am I thinking in the wrong direction here and there is a simpler way of doing this? Really appreciate any help, since I have been struggling with this for quite a while now :stuck_out_tongue:"
1681,1558810016.1252,Cornell,"Hello!

So there are two ways I think about this in Elm when it comes up.

1. Render a backdrop element that covers the entire screen then detect clicks on that.  That’s usually used for modals and such.
2. Or do some bounding box math through a combination of <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Dom#getElement> and decoding x,y coords from the mouse click"
1680,1558810407.1262,Danika,"You could probably write a custom event decoder that decodes target, no? "
1680,1558810541.1264,Marquitta,"thanks for your response! I was considering option 1, but in my case it is just a dropdown, so I dont think I want to have a backdrop.
I have managed to make it work as you described in option 2, but it felt kinda ""dirty"" :slightly_smiling_face: So what I did was saving last click from `onMouseDown` in the model and returning a command that would call `Dom.getElement`, and then when the result comes back checking whether the last click position is outside the element :woman-facepalming: I feel like I am doing it wrong, would you do it differently? :slightly_smiling_face:"
1681,1558811110.1266,Cornell,"I agree it’s a little funky :slightly_smiling_face:  Let’s see.  :thinking_face:; Yeah, you can’t decode a target, probably because its a dom node :thinking_face:  We could try to get the bounding box of the drop down as soon as it’s opened."
1681,1558811427.127,Marquitta,Yes! I just started thinking in the same direction :slightly_smiling_face:
1681,1558811436.1272,Cornell,"so, `OpenDropDown` sets the dropdown to open and fires the `Dom.getElement`; yeah!"
1681,1558811515.1276,Marquitta,"and then I get the click position in `MouseDown Position` and should already have the element in the model, right?"
1681,1558811535.1278,Dorotha,"What about keeping a boolean of a mouse being within a dropdown using `mouseover` and `mouseout`, and using this in `Browser.Events.onMouseDown`? I’m not sure if this works on touch devices though."
1681,1558811612.128,Cornell,"yeah, you should…its a little weird because there’s a brief period where you have a dropdown that’s open but with no bounding box in your model.; but maybe just close the dropdown if that occurs?; it should be a super brief period"
1681,1558811698.1286,Marquitta,"yes, I think it should be fine, the user can't be that fast anyway :wink:; <@Dorotha> that sounds interesting, but wouldn't it be a but too heavy to track `mouseover` event?"
1681,1558811819.129,Cornell,Another way to approach dropdowns that’s with sorta sneaky CSS is to show the dropdown when the element has `:focus-within`
1681,1558811820.1292,Dorotha,Doesn’t sound heavy if you attach it only when the dropdown is opened.
1681,1558811839.1294,Cornell,<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within>; but depends how weird you wanna get with CSS tricks
1681,1558812014.1299,Marquitta,"wooow, I didn't even think about this trick, but I actually have an autocomplete with a dropdown, so it is an input field and a list of options under it. I guess it is a perfect fit for using `:focus-within` to open/close the dropdown?"
1681,1558812253.1301,Cornell,"yeah, that might workout then.  If you can just use `:focus` instead of `:focus-within` you’ll have better browser compatibility.

Also a good trick to use with `:focus` is to remember you can using the sibling selector to affect the next element.

so
```
.searchbar:focus ~ .my-dropdown { opacity: 1 }
```
would style the dropdown if it comes directly after the input
```
&lt;input class=""searchbar"" /&gt;
&lt;div class=""my-dropdown""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```"
1681,1558812383.1303,Dorotha,^ this wouldn’t work when you click on something in the dropdown. I tried this and needed to add a workaround of calling Dom.focus to put the focus back
1681,1558812402.1305,Cornell,"right, good point :slightly_smiling_face:"
1681,1558812437.1307,Dorotha,"This is also not accessible, because users wouldn’t be able to focus the items."
1681,1558812454.1309,Cornell,so you’d likely need `focus-within`
1681,1558812511.1311,Marquitta,"yes, I think I can use it, browser compatibility is not a big issue for me. thanks for all the help!"
1681,1558812523.1313,Cornell,"no prob, good luck!"
1681,1558812588.1317,Marquitta,"<@Dorotha> I will actually try and see if I can implement your solution right away now, it sounded interesting :slightly_smiling_face:; yeah, that worked nicely, such a creative solution :slightly_smiling_face: the only problem I have with it, is that the history of messages gets heavily polluted with mouseover events"
1682,1558814445.1324,Dorotha,"I think I found a way using `focusout` event and checking if the `relatedTarget` element is within the dropdown element. I built it in JS, but should be possible to do the `relatedTarget` check in the event decoder <https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MdGveV>"
1681,1558814930.133,Marquitta,is it possible to decode this `relatedTarget` from the event? I think it might be tricky to get `parentNode` out of it .. do you have any resources you can point me to?
1682,1558815036.1332,Dorotha,"How familiar are you with JSON decoders in Elm? It is possible to treat the event object as a JSON value, and decode the Message out of it. <https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest/Html-Events#on>"

1681,1558816312.1339,Marquitta,"yeah, I don't think I understand how to do it. `parentNode` needs to be decoded recursively, is it possible to decode recursive structures?"
1683,1558816449.1341,Cornell,"yeah, you’ll need to use `Decode.lazy`"

Therefore I came to conclusion that the software I write and open source should really be GPL - because it ensures that I essentially get all derivative contributions back, and there is still an option to purchase a commercial license allowing to use my software in commercial, closed-source projects.

1714,1559052327.2631,Julie,"Hi, I'm still new to elm programming and I was looking at the elm/browser repository. In fact, I was wonder how to enable the Debug session with awesome Time Travelling. But I realised that it's a bit buggy.
And actually, there is a Pull Request to fix that in the elm/browser repo:
<https://github.com/elm/browser/pull/40>

My question is, who is suppose to accept PR on this repository? And why does it take so long? It's like, debbuging tool is important, isn't it?"
1714,1559052864.2674,Raylene,"Hello <@Julie>, and welcome! Elm it's still at version 0.19 (notice the leading 0), and Evan strongly believes in doing things Right rather than Right Now. Pull requests are, for good or bad, usually ignored, as Evan focuses on building what he feels to be important.
You enable debugging with the `--debug` flag. Did you come across the bug referenced in the PR?"
1714,1559053564.2701,Julie,"I understand the way Evan makes Elm evolves and it's at some point brillant, but in some case, there are some tiny fix that could be done by Mister Nobody :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes I compiled with the option `--debug` and I am exactly the situation described by this PR.; I didn't try to use the fix proposed by this PR, but it seems raisonnable to fix this situation."
1714,1559053717.272,Nana,"I heard it takes a fair amount of work to release a new version, the pipeline isn't super streamlined I guess, so it's not just a matter of merging and clicking ""deploy"""

<@Nana> oh, OK I see. Maybe some invest should be done in this direction, to have a reliable deployement"
1714,1559054133.2755,Nana,"although they did just release the ""no dependencies"" patch, so I don't know :man-shrugging: maybe that was higher priority, since npm audit was saying Elm contained dangerous code"

<@Nana> No way! Do you a link to this npm audit? Seems funny and I'm curious."
1714,1559054228.2787,Emilee,"There is also a different issue: the fix might be easy, but that doesn’t mean that it’s the best fix in the long term. Evan has stated on multiple occasions that he prefers collecting issues and analyzing how best to solve them overall over pushing quick fixes "
1714,1559054508.2788,Nana,"also I guess that was probably less work since it wasn't a new compiler, just an update to the npm installer; I think npm audit complained that the tar package which the installer used was a potential attack vector; <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C13L7S5GR/p1557515081019400>"

1714,1559062178.2906,Alicia,"<@Julie> for 0.19 there is no easy way to fix it in a fork or something like that, you would need to fork the compiler because the package includes native code; whether something is the best fix in the long term doesn’t mean that short term fixes can’t be applied, it seems like it is a matter of resources and time more than anything; linux kernel development has their subsystem maintainers that would handle this sort of scenario for bugfixes in a package, but I don’t think there are enough people in the Elm community to work in that fashion"
1714,1559063571.298,Julie,"<@Alicia> yeah, I see what you mean. It's a bit shame because, as Elm is an open source project, it's a perfect condition to help from the community for the best of the project. Some developpement/maintaining effort should be delegated to the community I think, because it's not a difficult task, many people out there can achieve it, and will be happy to do it and it's important task in a long run to ensure the qualtily of the project. Of course, it's only my 2 cents."
1714,1559063662.2986,Danika,"If you're aware of evans goals and process, then you know that he doesn't disagree that this should happen. It's a matter of _when_."
1714,1559063822.2998,Julie,"I watch many of his really good presentation, really good, but I'm not actually aware of a kind of roadmap, or things like that."
1717,1559063936.2999,Jacquelyn,How would that work <@Nana>? Can I get access to the `ValidityState` object from Elm? Maybe register to listen to it in the textfield?

1714,1559073797.3065,Casey,"I wonder if we’ll ever see an elm fork. Elm does seem far more closed than most open source projects, but compiler toolchains usually don’t have too many contributors in the first place"
1714,1559074082.309,Danika,"The idea has floated around in my head a few times. But not to usurp Elm or Evan, I'd like to add first-class Web Audio support but to say I'm not the right person for the job would be a big understatement ^^"
1714,1559074183.3099,Alicia,there’s one fork for the `Map.!` bug and some other stuff
1714,1559074226.3102,Raylene,"<@Marc> there already is a minor [as in, only patches applied] fork of the compiler. I think that *the community* will not fork because there is a lot of faith in the work of Evan and most believe that while yes, it would be nice to have the bugfixes and move faster, but we trust that in the long run the outcome will be better; Also, as you said compiler toolchains tend to be gnarly"
1714,1559076356.3148,Alicia,"yeah, I think forking is a bad way to go and realistically nobody is going to be able to match Evan, I do wish there was a way to get more community involvement in working on the small things so that Evan can stay focused on what he wants to work on, there’s a lot of busy work in responding to issues, PRs, questions, maintaining the package site, the guide, etc, etc."
1714,1559079872.316,Casey,If I were in Evans shoes I’d accept PRs that don’t change the language itself
1719,1559079892.3167,Casey,But I’m not and I’d rather benefit from his work than complain about how he does it 
1720,1559080188.3189,Cammy,"There was an experiment last year in which the core team tried to clone Evan using state of the art technology, and at first it worked well, the clones had slight differences, but they were close enough to do excellent API design, but soon the clones wanted their own clones to help with trivial tasks like going to the DMV or testing on BSD running on Raspberry Pi, so the clones started making copies of the copies, and soon it was just mayhem."
1714,1559082807.3192,Julie,"I completely agree with the idea to avoid useless development effort, to avoid to seed fork of fork and so on, but maybe there is a way in between.

In the Elm organisation, you have 5 main people listed: <https://github.com/orgs/elm/people>
Maybe one of them can dedicate a decent among of its time just to handle tiny bug fixes supplied by Pull Request form the Community, or the documentation fix, or the continous integration process improvement, or the deployement process improvement, or any improvement that costs time but not deep understanding.

Actually, at a glance you can qualify roughly a Pull Request: regression fix, documentation fix, new feature, breaking API, bull shit (I said roughly), and so on.
As rebecca.skinner said, if a Pull Request doesn't change the language itself, just preserve it or fix it to maintain the quality of Elm, it worth time investment IMHO.

I know Evan may think in another way, but raesonabily it's possible there is somebody in the Elm organisation of confidence which can handle this kind of tasks and would be happy to do it.
There is no doubt that everybody here on Slack like very much (or love) the work of Evan done around this great language, ecosystem, way of thinking that Elm represent, but just ignoring Pull Request from well intentioned people is a bit rough (especially for an open source project) and does not serve the willing of spreading Elm all around the world.

(I know, this topic has been discussed many times before, maybe if every planets are aligned, things can change for the best.)"
1714,1559082948.3215,Dede,"I suspect the issue is that many PRs require a great deal of mental energy to assess for quality, for impact on language semantics, for impact on future development plans, etc.  and even the work of identifying “simple” ones interrupts flow on larger tasks."
1714,1559083094.3229,Danika,"Really anything other than the simplest of bugfixes can have a knock-on effect on the development of the rest of the language. If you covered a tshirt with a 100 different patches of fabric it probably wouldn't look like the same tshirt no matter how small those patches were :innocent: Elm is _very_ young, in the grand scheme of things."

1714,1559083851.3282,Julie,"I like tshirt without hole  (or at least with the fewest hole as possible). Patches should be of the same color of the original tshirt, and in a way you could not notice the patch because the stiching is so thin."
1714,1559083892.3287,Danika,"At the risk of stretching this analogy way too far...

&gt; Patches should be of the same color of the original tshirt

1721,1559089689.3312,Myron,"is it by design that a generic function can't recursively call itself with new type arguments? it feels like a bug that this gives a compile error

test : a -&gt; b -&gt; ()
test x y = test y x

but this compiles:
```
test : a -&gt; b -&gt; ()
test x y = test2 y x

test2 = test

The 1st argument to `test` is not what I expect:

This `y` value is a:

Hint: Your type annotation uses `b` and `a` as separate type variables. Your
code seems to be saying they are the same though. Maybe they should be the same
in your type annotation? Maybe your code uses them in a weird way?

1722,1559094272.3361,Kris,"That's not really a workaround for it, because you're not calling the function recursively anymore; I'm not sure of other problems with it; Haskell, for example, rejects some poly rec functions, like `f (x:xs) = 1 + f [xs]` without a type annotation (because it can't infer it correctly), but it accepts it with `f :: [a] -&gt; Int`"

how are elm-analyse and elm-format doing it?

1731,1559148921.3715,Virgie,"the error messages are very hardcoded. This is its great strength, because this means the errors can be very specific. I think a project like this just has to mean forking the compiler and seeing where you get.

Even though there are not a lot of comments, it is some of the nicest haskell code I've seen; also when you do this, be sure to fork at a particular version (0.19 right now) because master often does not compile"

also, the elm-compiler code is not very extendable, but it is well-organized, so I’d suggest starting to take a look at it — and in the context of a thesis project, I think it’d be reasonable to just for the compiler and modify the parts you need — that’s what I did for starting elm-format; I forked the compiler and then stripped out all the stuff I didn’t need, and then slowly modified the remaining parsing phase over time"

I'm having issues with `Browser.application`. From what I understood, if I'm using `Browser.application` and I click an `a` tag with an `href` attribute, my Elm code should be called before the new page load happens.
Part of my page is in React.
When I click a link in the Elm part, my urlRequest listener is called. When I click a link in the React part, it isn't.
Is this normal behaviour?"
1780,1559667812.0094,Lindsey,"<@Tawnya> Its my understanding that you use application if you want elm to 'own' the page.  If elm is just a part on that page then element is what you want.  Elm doesn't know about anything outside itself (unless you tell it via ports) so it won't know about clicks in react.; if elm is trying to manage the url and also react is doing the same thing, hijinks may ensue."
1780,1559668026.0113,Tawnya,"Thanks <@Lindsey>. Actually, Elm is controlling the entire page, but I have React widgets inside the Elm bit,
I've just figured out that actually the url capturing only works for nodes rendered by the Elm virtual DOM <https://github.com/elm/browser/blob/1.0.1/src/Elm/Kernel/Browser.js#L157>; So I will have to capture the React ones myself and pop them through a port."

const fetchEffect = (url, cmd) =&gt; ({
  url,

  run (dispatch) {
    fetch(this.url).then(data =&gt; dispatch(this.cmd, data))

We can assume that dispatch is some function that the runtime provides to trigger `update`. Is this code pure? It obviously has side effects, we perform a fetch request. But we pass off the actual operation to the runtime, which is off in a library that we don't see."
1785,1559746533.0311,Karissa,"<@Leoma> <@Nana> yes a `static` local variable is the same variable for each call, it's not scoped to a particular invocation of that function (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12186857/on-local-and-global-static-variables-in-c>)"

Is there a standard way to parse query strings? With Url.Parser I can get the query string itself, but I was hoping to have it turned into a Dict."
1794,1559816621.0687,Lynne,There is a `Url.Parser.Query` module; It can’t just give you a dict with arbitrary keys though. You need to know parameter names and their types to use this module.

1794,1559818347.0731,Lynne,Feels very jquery’ish :smile:
1795,1559818366.0734,Danika,I’m just interested in fielding some opinions about the separation of the View and events; In a good way or a bad way?
1795,1559818389.0739,Lynne,Neither nor; It just seems to be a jquery way: given a document find everything matching criteria and enrich it with something; Click handlers in this case
1795,1559818486.0745,Huong,"Reminds me of cycles.js. I don’t know if it was considered; but to me it seems like prone to breakage and typos. Of course, a type-safe selector syntax could be thought up, but you’d still end up with having 2 separate places that need to know about your document structure, rather than _only_ the view.

Personally, I like to think of the view as being a subscription: it’s triggered on every update, and sets up a way to gather incoming events."
1795,1559818559.0747,Earlean,"Yeah, you can certainly think of `view` as a subscription."
1795,1559818591.0749,Lynne,"Yeah, same thinking, though sometimes you just can’t get rid of dispatching clicks from `subscriptions` but in my practice it was the other way around: if clicked on something EXCEPT &lt;this&gt; do this"
1795,1559818611.0751,Huong,"(similar to how `onUrlRequest`/`onUrlChange` in `Browser.application` are basically “a mandatory subscription”, and - in 0.18 - were actually implemented as an implicit subscription)"
1795,1559818621.0753,Lynne,Like if you want to hide an open dropdown by clicking elsewhere
1795,1559818644.0755,Earlean,Attaching event handlers to your view elements via subscriptions would require a lot of duplicated logic because your subscriptions would need to result in the right event handlers being created for the current elements in the `view`; That was always the problem with Jquery
1795,1559818686.0759,Danika,"Yes, it’s very similar to cycle’s “sinks”. It’s reasonable to conceptualise the view as a type of subscription, which is partly why I’ve been thinking about this alternative way of doing things.

(to be clear, I don’t expect / want / think elm should change to this, but its interesting to think about)

Right now `subscriptions` is the place to respond to events, _except_ for the DOM that’s special. I wonder whether that separation is necessary / useful."
1795,1559818731.0761,Huong,"Yeah, from the “mandatory subscription” POV, the separation makes sense to me"
1795,1559818765.0763,Earlean,"Subscriptions is called after every `update` but `view` waits for the animation frame, that's an important difference"
1795,1559818839.0765,Danika,"&gt; Indeed, although the implementation itself is perhaps another discussion.
<@Earlean> I’d really like to just focus the discussion on the premise, rather than how to make it happen.
<@Huong> more sense that cycle’s sinks?; &gt; Attaching event handlers to your view elements via subscriptions would require a lot of duplicated logic because your subscriptions would need to result in the right event handlers being created for the current elements in the `view`
I can see [duplicated logic] being both a positive and a negative. Given both would be created from the same model it should be difficult to attach the _wrong_ listeners.

You’re right that for the majority of applications you’d probably end up verbatim copying logic from the view to subscriptions, but there are some more complicated usecases where separating event logic from view logic may be useful; For context, I’m building an elm-like framework in js with a focus on audio applications. There’s a uniform api for creating DOM nodes and Web Audio nodes but audio events go in the `subscriptions` equivalent, it got me thinking why the dom gets “special treatment” in this regard"
1795,1559819837.0771,Lynne,"I think, mostly for convenience sake"
1795,1559820096.0773,Danika,"There are probably some genuine performance / implementation issues too, but fair enough! Thanks for the discussion everyone."
1795,1559820431.0775,Earlean,"Early Elm had  Signals which unifies a lot of event handling but it turns out to be difficulty for beginners, had some hard to understand gotchas and usage converged on TEA anyway"
1795,1559820501.0777,Danika,"I think signals are another kettle of fish, I agree that FRP can be a complex beast _especially_ if you’re knew to fp in general as well"
1796,1559832936.0803,Tawnya,"Hey folks, I'm using `Url.Parser.Query` and I'm not finding it the most straightforward thing really.
Does anyone know why it defines its own `Parser` type instead of using the parser from the `Parser` module? It doesn't have `andThen`, `succeed` or `problem` which are functions that would make life quite a bit easier."
1796,1559836748.0808,Lynne,"Probably it was developed for different set of scenarios <@Tawnya> What is your case if you could share?; `Url.Parser` does not expose `andThen`, `succeed` and `problem` either. It looks like you compare it with `elm/parser`’s `Parser` but that is a completely different thing."
1796,1559837810.0828,Tawnya,"Yep, that is my question. Why is it a completely different thing? Aren't both cases for string parsing?"
1796,1559837897.0839,Lynne,`elm/parser`’s `Parser` is a generic tool to parse whatever string but `Url.Parser` is more like a DSL to represent how URLs are structured. It is much higher level and thus more limited.; But I am not the author of the package so I am only guessing
1797,1559856763.0858,Erlene,"I have some JavaScript that needs to get some value out of an Elm model. So I can send a message using subscriptions, but I suppose that returns immediately without any value. How do I wait properly for Elm to return me that message?"
1797,1559856880.0862,Niesha,"There's no way to wait synchronously, gotta do it async."
1797,1559857371.0864,Erlene,"hmm, polling is annoying."
1797,1559857556.087,Danika,You can promisify the two ports
1797,1559857614.0874,Erlene,"ah, thanks, I've never used that technique, need to look into that."
1797,1559857791.0888,Lindsey,"I dunno what promisifying is, but you can set up a port with a callback in js, for data that comes out of elm.  Then you send your request in via another port.  Elm gets the message and responds by hopefully calling your callback."
1797,1559858348.0898,Erlene,"<@Danika> are there any examples? I can't easily see how this will work. I was looking at util.promisify(), but my elm calls are of a different kind then the examples I see."
1797,1559858684.0904,Nana,yeah it's a little different in this case since Elm doesn't use the request/callback model
1798,1559858712.0906,Nana,but should be doable
1797,1559858807.0911,Niesha,"Send a token along, and succeed the Promise once a response with that token comes back"
1797,1559859018.0924,Hoyt,"<@Adrianna> Just wanted to say that we’ve started using your form-decoder library, and it is really great, so far."
1797,1559859106.0938,Briana,"<@Erlene> Are you familiar with Ports? You'll probably have something like this:

```
app.ports.myFunction.subscribe(function(data) {
  // in here, data is the thing you're looking for
});
```

Where `myFunction` is a `port` (defined in Elm)."
1797,1559859167.0945,Erlene,"<@Briana> the issue is not with ports, perfectly familiar with them. This is the first time my JavaScript needs to retrieve a value from an Elm model. That does not appear to be super easy."
1797,1559859195.0951,Briana,"Javascript doesn't have a way to reach into Elm and get anything, per say.; You'll need to setup your Javascript to expect that, some day, at some point, the Elm code will push the value out.; (Via a port); _Something_ needs to happen to trigger that value getting sent to the JS (even if that something is the application initializing)."
1797,1559859375.0986,Erlene,"<@Briana> I need to get a specific named value from a model, the specific name varies, and comes from the javascript side. To continuously copying all these values to javascript is not needed, especially since this is only needed for running BDD tests."
1797,1559859463.1006,Briana,You could definitely create an incoming port (JS -&gt; Elm) that passes the key of the thing you need and have an outgoing port (Elm -&gt; JS) that passes the value back in response.
1797,1559859473.1011,Kris,I don’t understand why you don’t seem to want to use ports
1797,1559859503.1012,Briana,"It's my impression that, especially in 0.19, there isn't a choice."
1797,1559859528.1018,Kris,I was talking to <@Erlene> 
1797,1559859539.102,Briana,Yup!
1797,1559859579.1022,Erlene,"<@Kris> I definitely am using ports! The point is that I need to poll for the response.; <@Briana> yes, that's how it works. The problem is I need to poll for the response."
1797,1559859645.1039,Briana,"Why do you need to poll for the response? Shouldn't the port's callback on the JS side trigger every time the port is fired from Elm?; (I'm almost certainly missing something about your testing setup, so I apologize if I'm way off base here!); (Also, I'm so sorry, but I need to run. I'll try to be around on phone!)"
1797,1559859834.106,Erlene,it needs to appear to be synchronous to the caller.
1799,1559872319.1068,Dexter,"I think I had a similar problem Berend.
Ended up wrapping up my calls with transactions ids. Then when Elm has handled your cmd it returns the result with the given transaction id; (and on the JS part the port is wrapped by a class that just returns a promise and resolves when Elm is ready)"
1797,1559874727.1072,Erlene,"Yeah, the promise stuff is new to me, not immediately clear to handle that. Have seen another person mention transaction ids as well. Is that something special, or just a random opaque value?; Has anyone ever passed a file from javascript to Elm 0.19 using elm/file?; I'm thinking this should be possible using the Elm.File.decoder perhaps."
14510,1559878905.1095,Earlean,"Yep, you can send a file in to Elm as a Json.Decode.Value via a port or flags or grab it off an event"
